On the other hand in france they have been pointing out there might be 100k daily cases. I think numbers are not realistic also in other countries, they did not give figures but I think also the italian authorities believe the new cases are undercounted.

I've read contrasting views on the US healthcare system on here: some say the costs are restrictive others says they're all covered on insurance and basic social security so cost isn't a deterrent. I wouldn't know with not being an American.

I've been to the United States and from a purely anecdotal, observational perspective I would say there is no noticeable health difference when compared with England, although I've just been reading that in terms of diagnosed diabetes it's 2.7% of the population in England and 5% in the United States, and I do know that somewhere around 25% of those people who lost their lives in England, during March to August, had diagnosed diabetes.
