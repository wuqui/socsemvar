[],,_________axa,,,[],,,,text,t2_zrgtsz5,False,False,[],"Firstly, as was mentioned below, it costs money to stay home out of precaution alone. Most companies and small business are telling employees if they aren’t confirmed COVID infected they have to return to work. And secondly that’s besides the point in terms of testing protocols on the hospitals. The hospital I work at, (and from what I’ve heard from all of the neighboring hospitals in my area) are unwilling to test symptomatic patients if they haven’t had contact with an active case, or if they haven’t left the country in the last 6 months. This is vastly negligent seeing as it’s next to impossible for anyone to know if every person they have had contact with in the last 2 weeks has either 1) left the country recently or 2) is now symptomatic. ( ie: I don’t know anything about my grocery store worker who checked me out yesterday morning or the old man I helped direct in at the gas station last week etc.) Not to mention these are patients that are presenting with full blown symptoms, AND are testing negative for the flu. We still will not test them if they haven’t said yes to either 1) having left the country in the last 6 months or 2) confirm they have been in contact with a patient that is positive. 

To your defense, at this point in the game, the infrastructures and protocols with which all of our institutions are functioning are so under prepared and under testing, it is almost better for people who are gravely ill with flu like symptoms to try their best to stay home and self quarantine seeing as the hospitals will be turning them away if they don’t have the final requirement anyway. This will help to avoid undue spreading from potential vectors seeking help in the attempt to get tested. Sue diligence is necessary, but the hospitals HAVE to function under the guidelines dictated by our state health departments and CDC governances, and it forces us to increase risk of spreading at this stage in the outbreak. (And I want to note that I and all of my fellow HCWs are the vast negligence in this manner of proceeding. We simply have no other options) Until we have more capacity to test and better protocols we are doing disservice’s by having potential COVID patient sit in waiting rooms and going to minute clinics to expose HCWs and the community when they will inevitably be denied testing.",,2020-03-14 18:42:31,{},fki3qja,False,t3_fid14s,False,True,t1_fkgm7ik,/r/Coronavirus/comments/fid14s/america_isnt_testing_for_the_most_alarming/fki3qja/,1584211529,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,0,1584204151.0,,,
