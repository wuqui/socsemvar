Most countries deemed covid success stories so far have done so by locking down and ensuring proper contact tracing. US said no and developed an entirely new vaccine platform in less than a year. 

During WW1 the US stayed isolationist until the end when it looked like things weren’t going to go well for the western world. Then it came in and did a victory lap which led to the US becoming a world player for the first time in history. 

WW2 the US was a non-entity until Pearl Harbor was attacked by conventional weapons by an imperialist force. And then the country detonated nuclear bombs on an enemy for the first time in history. Completely changing geopolitics. 

Jonas Salk invented the polio vaccine in the wake of the worst polio outbreak in history. Came in and completely changed the vaccine game. 

Literally every major wave of immigration in the US was the result of massive unrest or awful situations in the homeland of the immigrants. And without fail every single group that’s come here has improved their lot. Irish Potato famine? Within a few generations an Irish man held the presidency. Vietnam war? Vietnamese Americans are now one of the most solidly middle class groups in the country. Etc etc. 


So yeah I think the country has a way of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat in a way that massively overtakes the initial problem.
