What they don’t want you to know that 90%-100% of all tax dollars received goes to feed the “wildlife” that depends on the government assistance in one form or another. 

That’s right. 

When the government collects $4 million times 1 million dollars ($4 trillion), depending on the year 90%-100%+ goes toward federal poverty programs or servicing the interest on the federal debt. 

The rest of government, military, usps, federal employees is funded by borrowing money from the federal reserve, that simply prints the money out of thin air. 

And who pays the super majority of taxes?

The top 20% of income earners pay about 80% of all federal tax dollars collected. 

The bottom 50% of all income earners pay around 3%. 

So basically, if you pay taxes, you are paying for L’Dasha to get knocked up 15 times over her lifetime by 12 different dads, with each extra kid earning her additional welfare benefits. 


In other words, if you pay taxes, you are a dumb schmuck paying for some harlot you have never met to get free healthcare, free food, free housing, free edjumacation, free money every month. 

You are effectively a sugar daddy that gets pistol whipped for not paying your honey but get nothing in return...

I'm also pretty sure she would drug us sometimes I know she would let my older siblings drink and smoke weed, 10+ year difference between them and me and my younger sister, and either directed by her or through them having to essentially be the ones who raised and took care of me would dope me up either by blowing smoke at me or through giving me alcohol. I don't blame my siblings though they lived in hell also from what I know so they did the best they could. You know that evil woman from the movies who fucks her husband friends in his office and shit just to be evil, yeah that's my mom and it went even further and still in some small ways continues to this day of her pitting us against each other(my siblings) and pitting us against my dad in ever way you could imagine including implanting the idea in me my older sister and younger sisters heads that my dad molested my older sister. That is truly fucked and once implanted can never truly do fully away and even though my older sister as admitted how my mom pimped her out she insists that the idea couldn't have been implanted but my older brother told me for a fact it's a lie but it was repeated long enough and often enough that it stuck. Investigations happened and nothing ever came of it and she withdrew the claim once they started getting shit on her in the investigation. I often forget about this part because to me she is still my sister but as it turns out she is only my half sister and that came out through manipulation of her by my mom to get a dna test with my dad. That shit devastated him and I damn near went and killed the bitch(my mom) for it. The few early life memories I do have are of my older sister taking care of me and my first word was her name, I suspect because when I cried my mom yelled her name and she literally raised me for the most part.
