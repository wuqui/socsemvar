You've become aware of a profound psychological trait.

You might have noticed the same sort of behavior if you put your finances in order, cut unnecessary spending, and put yourself on a financial path to early retirement. Similar response from family members are often shared over in /r/financialindependence.

If you passed through grade school within the United States you may have noticed the same trend from peers if you applied yourself and worked hard at something. Those working less hard may target you for the effort to try and drag you down to their level.

Applied to communities I've heard this described as cultural gravity. There are communities that push their kids to succeed and hold hard work and study in high esteem. They could be said to have less cultural gravity. In another community that holds less value on hard work and education, they may belittle and harass and talk you out of it. That's a harder cultural gravity to overcome, and that much more impressive when a person ignores the negative influences and do what they need to succeed anyway.

On the personal finance side the general advice is engage in your system and don't talk about it with family. It's not their business. It reduces conflict to avoid the topic. Now if they're willing to break open their budget and accept advice to help clean up bad habits and get on a road to wealth again, sure. But in a high percentage of families the topic can create drama.

I suspect we're seeing similar interaction with the preparing. Everyone agrees with the nebulous idea of emergency planning, but most haven't acted on it. You're engaged in the actual work of truly planning that can be completely detached from emotion. Not everyone wants to do their homework. It's easy to harass and tear down the people putting in hard work than to actually put in the effort.

Whereas people may have been transmitting the disease to 2-3 people a day in the early stages, a typical resident of the Hubei province (or anywhere in China at this point) isn't even interacting with 2-3 new people a day, and to the extent that they do encounter new people, those people are much more likely to already be taking serious precautions.

As for outside of China, serious spread gets gutted pretty quickly if it isn't being ignored in the early stages. Those numbers will be negligible unless it spreads to a country where no action is being taken. China was able to get to such a high count because the early spread wasn't caught (or wasn't being acted on). Taking action when two cases are turning into eight cases is still managable. Taking action when two hundred cases have turned into eight hundred cases is much tougher. 

As of late last week we were still seeing exponential growth despite the lockdown because of the lag caused by the incubation period along with administrative delays (waiting on test results etc), but today/tomorrow is when we should begin to see the benefits of the quarantine efforts. 

If the number of recorded cases continues to be similar to our predicted ""official"" number in the coming days, then it becomes safe to say we are at the end of exponential growth.
