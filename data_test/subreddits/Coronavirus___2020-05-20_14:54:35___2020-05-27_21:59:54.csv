They were led well and they got the virus under control and they got the infected numbers almost down to zero. Once you've done that you can start to open up without fear. If no one is infected then the virus cant spread right? Unlike other countries that open up whilst still having thousands of cases. What's not to understand? Croatia acted well and they're getting the reward they deserve.

It seems some people seem to interpret the situation in Croatia as, ""See people in Croatia aren't locked down and the virus isn't growing there.""

Are those people going to conveniently ignore the part where the country locked down fast and eradicated the virus? Dont take my word for it. Oxford University rated Croatia as implementing the strictest lockdown measures on the planet.
