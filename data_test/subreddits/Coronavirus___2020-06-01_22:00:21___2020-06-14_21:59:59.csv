All police should train in Jujutsu and feel confident enough to handle themselves even against larger opponents and not have to resort to a firearm if they feel things might get physical.

I can understand those like you saying this is a failure of WHO's communications, but I'm much more inclined to say it's a failure of news reporting. The news reports clipped a few sentences and phrases from the 4 or 5 minute answer, removed all the nuance and intention behind the words, and printed a misleading story with an even more misleading headline. The WHO conducts briefings every 2-3 days for an hour each. The three top officials answer questions from the press and try to provide updates on the current state of the pandemic. 

The question is, do we want the only communications from the WHO to be official communiques drafted by communications officers, ensuring every sentence and statement is carefully structured?

You have to completely unmount the filter, that means taking apart the  outter cardboard.  I watched some youtube vids on this which came in handly without having to cut any of the metal.

Next i laid the filter material flat under a heavy cutting board several days (10 days maybe??).  I misted the material once (very light misting) with  demineralized water to  remove the pleating. (you can leave it in, but you want to remove as much as you can because you will need to cut quite a few from a sheet) and then I rolled it up binding the sides put it in a clean trash bag.  That knocked out the rest of the kinks.  

Official word from 3M is to not do this even though there's no fiberglass present, however, a non fiberglass filter material in times of pandemic...yeah works perfect.  

Some came out better than others (but of course) but thats the basic drill .  you could see some of the kinks but very lightly   But you can't iron this stuff nor can you really ""wash it""  Misting it seems to be fine as long as it dries!   

Some filter companies who make the higher end filters and  use the exact same stuff as  3M(how about that!)  are selling the material by the sheet.  I  believe one of the facebook groups (maybe mask makers or someone that belongs to it) keeps a listing of where to buy the materials.  You still have to be careful though as some companies are out there to make a quick buck.",,2020-06-05 17:37:40,{},fszs7x9,False,t3_gwr8no,False,True,t1_fszor45,/r/Coronavirus/comments/gwr8no/this_nurse_didnt_just_create_a_replacement_n95/fszs7x9/,1591381472,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1591371460.0,,,

That's why I have been spending quite a bit of time looking at your posts. I very much appreciate the work you've put in to collecting information on this matter and I have learned quite few interesting things because of it.

I watched that video you posted and it was eye opening. On the other side of the world we haven't been as immersed in Sweden's ""moral authority"" propaganda, so I was quite surprised by how even some Swedish people see it as hugely (dangerously) arrogant.

Now I can see how Sweden got to where it is. I was assuming incompetence, but it seems self-delusion and denial is more accurate. It is very similar to how Americans perceive themselves.
