what's the problem? 

&amp;#x200B;

you want schools to open?

get your infection rate down to 3% - so bars or schools?... up to you.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The state conducted 70,000 tests on Aug. 6, of which **1% were positive,** Cuomo said. There were 5 virus-related fatalities and 579 hospitalizations as of Aug. 6, according to the latest state data.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;A New York City Department of Education survey to which 400,000 parents responded said **75% wanted their children to return to school.** Mayor Bill de Blasio had said New York City wouldn‚Äôt open schools **unless the city remains below a 3% citywide infection rate over a seven day rolling average.**

&amp;#x200B;

CA schools are officially closed for at least the fall semester.. but K-6 can apply for a waiver..

but there's a lot of stuff you have to prove (on paper).. 

A LOT.

[https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/In-Person-Elementary-Waiver-Process.aspx](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/COVID-19/In-Person-Elementary-Waiver-Process.aspx)

and the number one thing is that your county needs to be below a threshold

sounds a lot like Cuomo's plan, TBH.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;*CDPH recommends that schools within jurisdictions with 14-day case rates more than two times the threshold to be on the County Monitoring List (&gt;200 cases/100,000 population) should not be considered for a waiver to re-open in-person instruction.*

&amp;#x200B;

* Upon receipt of a waiver application, the LHO will review and consider the application, supporting materials, and the following:
   * Available scientific evidence regarding COVID-related risks in schools serving elementary-age students, along with the health-related risks for children who are not provided in-person instruction.
   * State law directing public schools to ""offer in-person instruction to the greatest extent possible."" (Ed. Code ¬ß 43504).
   * Whether elementary in-person instruction can be provided in small, stable cohorts.
   * Local health guidance, safety plans, availability of appropriate PPE, and availability of public health and school resources for COVID-19 investigation and response.
   * Current new case rate, testing % positivity trends, and the number and degree of indicators above thresholds to be on the County Monitoring List.
   * Local hospitalization trends and hospital capacity.
   * Any other local conditions or data contributing to inclusion on the County Monitoring List.
   * Availability of testing resources within the community and via employee health plans.
   * The extent to which the applicant has consulted with staff, labor organizations, community, and parent organizations.",,2020-08-07 16:45:07,{},g0p3p5e,False,t3_i5grhv,False,True,t3_i5grhv,/r/Coronavirus/comments/i5grhv/nyc_schools_can_hold_inperson_classes_bucking/g0p3p5e/,1596821611,1,False,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1596811507.0,,,

* **Schools reopen: what about the air in classrooms?**

In the vast majority of cases in schools, the question of whether filters are installed does not even arise. After all, there is no mechanical ventilation system in around 90 percent of the facilities, Moriske complains. As early as 2008, as a member of the Indoor Air Hygiene Commission of the Federal Environment Agency, he worked on a guide for indoor hygiene in school buildings. They talk about problems such as fine dust pollution, carbon dioxide concentrations, mold or chemical substances in the air. According to Moriske, this content is still relevant, especially when it comes to ventilation recommendations. ""We made the mistake of not ventilating many rooms in the past that we should have ventilated. In particular, I wouldTake the school sector as an example, ""confirms Dirk M√ºller from RWTH Aachen University.


* **And what to do in schools and offices without air conditioning?**

What was already a problem in times before Corona is currently taking revenge in two ways. In the short term, the only thing that helps is regular ventilation with the window open - no matter how cold or wet it is outside. The scientists Moriske and M√ºller point to a carbon dioxide (CO2) traffic light system that should help at this point. The concentration of CO2 in the room air is a good parameter for air quality. If it rises above a certain threshold, the traffic light, which is linked to a measuring device, could jump to yellow or red - a signal that needs to be ventilated. And that would not only transport stale air out of the room, but also dilute possible aerosols. Such a traffic light could just as well be used in other settings such as offices to check air quality quickly and easily.


* **So do everything outside if possible?**

It is not without reason that the risk of infection with Covid-19 is lower outdoors than indoors . The faster a breeze does not distribute five micrometer aerosols with the virus, i.e. dilutes and exchanges the air, the lower the risk ( Am. J. Infection Control: Knibbs et al., 2011 ). First reconstructions of exactly where people were infected during the corona pandemic show: Celebrations or church services, restaurants or offices are the places where, according to previous knowledge, infections most often occur ( Wellcome Open Research: Leclerc et al., 2020 , preprint : Quian et al., 2020). So as long as it is possible in summer: move as many activities as possible outdoors. And ventilation, ventilation, ventilation .

* **Aerosols and corona - where breathing becomes a risk**

Not only sneezing and coughing can be dangerous: Sars-CoV-2 is also transmitted through the air. What makes aerosol particles so treacherous and how you can protect yourself.


* **And what will happen then in autumn and winter?**
When life inevitably shifts back inside, ventilation becomes all the more important. Where there is an air conditioning system, it should, as now, be used with the highest possible proportion of fresh air and a high volume flow. Technically, it is usually not possible to retrofit an air conditioning system with Hepa filters. If there is no mechanical ventilation system, the only thing that helps is: Open the window. 
You can also buy mobile filter systems. Some of these also work with Hepa filters or UV radiation, which are supposed to render the virus harmless. However, they are not particularly suitable for places such as school classes or larger offices because not enough air can be circulated. This is confirmed by Moriske, M√ºller and the Rehva position paper already quoted . ""UV light can also lead to a safety risk for users outside of commercial areas,"" warns Moriske. 


* **How is it going now, for example on the train?**

When asked about the air quality, the railway only informs in writing that there are rarely infections with Covid-19 on trains. Regarding the ventilation system, it goes on to say: ""A transfer of such particles via the air conditioning system of a train is extremely unlikely due to the very long ventilation paths, the drying of the air and the existing filters (class G4 - coarse dust filter). This is intensified by the fact that rail vehicles have a high air exchange rate (complete air exchange in an ICE approx. every 7.5 minutes) and thus a lot of fresh air is supplied. In addition, the trains have an active air volume control which regulates the fresh air supply depending on the occupancy of the trains Passenger is comparable and is significantly higher than that in buildings. ""

The comparison of the air exchange rate with buildings is a bit slow, since on the train, at least as a rule, more people are in the same area and sit close together. A higher exchange rate than in buildings does not necessarily mean better air quality. In addition, the filters described are not fine enough to be able to filter out viruses. There are currently no studies that could verify the statements made by Deutsche Bahn. The company is currently carrying out tests itself in cooperation with the German Aerospace Center (DLR), which are intended to examine the infection process in trains more closely.


* **Are airplane cabins really as sterile as an operating theater?**
Again and again , airlines recently claimed that the cabin air in their machines is about as pure as in the operating theater - because HEPA filters are also used. The air would be completely exchanged within a few minutes. But on closer inspection it shows : That is not true.

What is correct: Hepa filters are also installed in airplanes . Used cabin air is sucked into ventilation slots between the cabin floor and the wall, cleaned of particles and then mixed with fresh air from outside. It flows back into the passenger compartment through nozzles on the cabin ceiling. This should create a vertical air flow between the nozzle on the ceiling and the exhaust air systems on the floor. 

The problem: It takes more than a few minutes until all of the air is actually exchanged using this technology. And during this time the passengers sit together in a very confined space - no chance of keeping the necessary distance. Neither the larger droplets nor the smaller aerosols are therefore always fished out of the air quickly enough before the person sitting next to them or passengers sitting further away inhale them. In addition, the theory that air always flows straight down from the ventilation under the ceiling in order to be returned to the filter system as exhaust air on the floor has already been refuted by scientists. Differences in temperature in the cabin and air movements certainly cause turbulence - which means that aerosols are also distributed in the cabin. 

The claim that air travel is as safe as an appendectomy, at least as far as the risk of Covid 19 infection is concerned, is simply wrong.


* **Have not people already been infected on the plane?**

Yes. The first cases from the current Covid-19 pandemic have been reported. On a flight from Singapore to Hangzhou on January 23 of this year, twelve people were infected with the corona virus . Incidentally, the man who brought the pathogen from Wuhan onto the plane did not wear a respirator ( Infectious Diseases: Yang et al., 2020 ). 

A similar case occurred during the Sars epidemic , which killed nearly 350 people in mainland China and nearly 300 others in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003. It was triggered by the predecessor of today's coronavirus called Sars-CoV-1 and caused the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars), also a respiratory disease, similar to the currently immediate coronavirus, which affects the lungs, but also other organsinfested. On a flight on March 15, 2003 from Hong Kong to Beijing, 22 people were infected with Sars-CoV-1. What was interesting about the case was that only eight of them were sitting in the immediate vicinity of the person who was already sick. The authors of the study assume that passengers or flight crew who moved during the flight could have distributed aerosols in the aircraft ( The New England Journal of Medicine: Olsen et al., 2003 ). 
And using the example of influenza viruses - the flu - researchers were able to show in a model that infectious particles were also detectable a few rows away from the infected person ( Indoor Air: Jitendra et al., 2012 ).


* **What now protects against Corona on the plane?**

The European Aviation Safety Authority has issued recommendations for action (as a PDF) to reduce the risk of infection on board. However, there is no requirement to be able to better comply with distance rules, for example with free center seats. Professor Qingyan Chen, one of the leading researchers in the field of bacterial contamination in airplanes, shows understanding that unused airplanes are not economical. He also told the Neue Z√ºricher Zeitung that in this case high-quality respiratory masks should be distributed, for example with filters of the type FFP2 or FFP3, which are a stronger barrier against viruses and aerosols. Surgical masks, as they are currently required, were not sufficient in the fully occupied plane.",,2020-08-11 12:40:41,{},g13h2ac,False,t3_i7oclc,False,True,t1_g13gadn,/r/Coronavirus/comments/i7oclc/coronavirus_no_the_air_on_airplanes_is_not_as/g13h2ac/,1597149652,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1597142441.0,,,
