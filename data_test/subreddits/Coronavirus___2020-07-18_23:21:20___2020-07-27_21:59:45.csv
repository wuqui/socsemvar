&gt;THE NUMBER OF Covid-19 cases in Sweden has doubled to almost 77,000 since the beginning of June, one of the highest rates of new cases in the European Union.

&gt;But officials in the country, whose softer approach to fighting the coronavirus drew global attention, say the spread of Covid-19 there is slowing.

&gt;In the last two weeks, Sweden was only second to Luxembourg in the EU in terms of new cases per capita, with new infections more than six times the European Union average.

&gt;Unlike most European countries, Sweden never imposed a lockdown and made headlines for its high death toll.

&gt;It has kept schools for under-16s open and has not closed cafes, bars, restaurants or most businesses. Masks have been recommended only for healthcare workers.

&gt;But over the past 60 days, Sweden has seen a drastic increase in the number of new cases.

&gt;On 31 May, the country had recorded a total of 39,160 cases. On July 16, the number had almost doubled at 76,877, but deaths had only increased by just over 20 percent to 5,593.

&gt;However, authorities stress that serious Covid-19 cases and associated deaths have declined.

&gt;“If you increase testing you will find more cases,” deputy state epidemiologist Anders Wallensten told the AFP news agency.

&gt;“But the more serious cases, those who become sick and need hospital care have rather decreased,” he added.

&gt;Sweden’s Public Health Agency instead has repeatedly stressed that the large increase is mostly made up of milder cases, which would have gone unnoticed previously.

&gt;US President Donald Trump has similarly said that the surges in cases around the US are related to increased testing.

&gt;But unlike the US, the rise in cases in Sweden has not been accompanied by an increase in intensive care unit admissions.",,2020-07-20 13:19:19,{},fynmo3a,True,t3_hul3d4,False,True,t3_hul3d4,/r/Coronavirus/comments/hul3d4/covid19_swedish_cases_double_to_77000_since_may/fynmo3a/,1595331154,3,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1595243959.0,,,

[],,notreallyswiss,,,[],,,,text,t2_5oe5d,False,False,[],"They didn’t get tons of free money to just put into their bank account.  It’s not a gift, first of all, it’s a low or no interest loan, and it’s to be used to make payroll, maintain inventory, potential clean up costs, insurance and rent payments, marketing and information to customers on changing availability or new services in response to Corona virus, exploring business options like online sales or expanding outdoor services to keep customers and employees safe.

I am an investor in a brew pub and the business received covid-19 relief.  One of the options the management thought to use the money for was to purchase the building where they operate.  However, the building is rented from close relatives of the two main owners.  It is a conflict of interest to use the loan for self-dealing like that, even if buying is more beneficial to the business than renting over the long haul - the money is to help the business pull through now, not enrich the owners or their relations at anyone’s expense.

What are they using the money for?  They created an on-line ordering system, took out ads in local newspapers advertising on-line ordering; hired more kitchen staff so that they can limit the number of people working at any one time - one person can prepare much of the to-go food in advance, but you need more full-time cooks to do it; hired contractors to expand dining area into former storage; are in the process of moving and improving a parking lot so that they can expand outdoor dining safely; are experimenting with different options for beer to go as the crowlers they had been using are in short supply; bought new sanitation equipment suited to providing take out food and beverage; purchased takeout containers and bags; started a paid intern program for both beer making and for chefs.

All of these things help keep them afloat and keep their employees that are still working paid.  In addition they are spreading money into the community by utilizing construction firms and hiring interns and cooks.  I am also personally pleased that I refused to invest in the business unless all employees were on the books, no under the table payments of servers or kitchen helpers as is common in this area (and it is not just owners who want to pay under the table - most people working these types of jobs In this area do not want to pay taxes or FICA on their earnings - in fact a few staff members quit once this was implemented.).

Puerto Ricans have been citizens of the United States since 1917, and can move freely between the island and the mainland. As it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the U.S. Congress, which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statehood\_movement\_in\_Puerto\_Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statehood_movement_in_Puerto_Rico)

Edit: I would like to see Puerto Rico get statehood if they want it. Then they would get federal dollars when a disaster happens. I don't get why people thought they are entitled to insurance and not have to pay for it.

Puerto Rico hopes to lure American mainlanders with an income tax of only 4%. **Legally avoiding the 37% federal rate** and the 13.3% California (or other state) rate sounds pretty good. What’s more, there is no tax on dividends, and no capital gain tax in Puerto Rico. I know their is a lot of other complex treaties.
