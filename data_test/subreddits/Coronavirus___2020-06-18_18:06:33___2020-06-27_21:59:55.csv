correlation does not equal casuality. the reason for this is in certain parts of world its a religious rite, and the populations that practice it have less sexual partners due to religion and strict adherance to marriage , if it does decrease infection the numbers are probaly less than negliable. the determining factor will always be how many sexual partners you have and with and without protection. the aids thing is just pushed by the circumcision crowd.

example hiv rate in sweden  0.20% , usa 0.30%( taken from wikipedia) yet sweden has a circumsion rate less than 1% compared to usa 58%.

also african countries have highest hiv of all continents and very high circumcision rates, take south africa for example 44% circumsion rate but a staggering 18% hiv rate. if anything the evidence points to it being more likely to catch it if circumcised as holding onto archaic religious rites often go hand in hand with other outdated religious practises such as not using condoms",,2020-06-19 23:35:18,{},fve15k9,False,t3_hc7b7i,False,True,t1_fvdf1rc,/r/Coronavirus/comments/hc7b7i/covid19_slows_down_circumcision/fve15k9/,1592611779,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1592602518.0,,,1592611260.0

And lots of people in general being tested until they get a negative not just for work. And we have people here that are testing positive, than next month like May negative, than come June positive and it's marked as a new case each time. Imagine that all over. 

I just had someone moron on neighborhoods app say his friends told him all the hospitals here (I'm in Broward) are overwhelmed here and looking to add more icu units. I'm like what friends, tin foil hat wearers? He's like my friends work at Borward, Holy etc. I text my cousin over there whose in the ER and neighbor whose nurse also there, complete bs lol. Reminds me when Delray got reported like that with multiple floors of Covid patients and ventilators being used, and my uncle whose an ER physician there was like not even 1/4 true or accurate. But that's where the fake news starts going viral and media picks up and people take it in thinking it's the end of the world.

Hospitals generally always operate at this capacity, if they didn't, they'd hemmorage even more money than they do (or borderline for majority). Our hospitals here were not overwhelmed this entire time regardless of what the media made it to be, hell they were furloughing employees left and right and that wasn't just private elective surgery spots either. 

Now the talks of actually adding more icu has been talked about for a long time and that part is true, even before this started and I know Boca has wanted to do that previously as I know board members there. But it's not as simple as adding icu units as icu is in their own floor sections. Your talking building additions out further which is $$$$ and anything medical related for construction is a cluster fuck getting approved for work.

100s of parents have kept their children home from school this spring, despite the authorities' clear message that school duty applies and that even if the parents belong to a risk group.

Anyone who keeps the children at home, however, risks being reported to social authorities, or being fined.

- There is no carrot there, but it is the whip that applies. Many parents are in total despair about being reported to social authorities. It's a huge trauma, says mom Lisa Meyler.

When in many countries they chose to close schools to reduce the spread of infection, the compulsory schools in Sweden continued to be open. **And even children of parents who belong to a risk group should go to school.** Exceptions are only made in very special cases.

If a student, despite calls, does not return to school, the municipality can issue fines and at least a handful have announced that they are prepared to do so.

In Helsingborg, Christian Olsson is Head of Operations at the School and Leisure Administration. He hopes that all children will be back in the fall, but otherwise it will be fine and they can be as high as SEK 10,000.

- It is clear that we have had a greater understanding this spring for choosing not to go to school. But we have to get back to what the lawmakers want and the lawmakers tell us to go to school and that's what it is.

Lisa Meyler has a chronic illness that makes her extra anxious about getting the coronary infection, which is why she has taught her 12-year-old daughter herself, something her municipality has now accepted in the spring.

She and more than 300 other parents have formed a Facebook group who are upset that municipalities are reporting concerns when children do not come to school. Lisa Meyler thinks that the authorities only talk about the children's right to be in school, without thinking that there can be even more important considerations.

- **Why not take into account the children who risk coming home and infecting their parents, who actually risk losing their lives or end up in intensive care. Why not take into account the best of the children, to have their parents in life, says Lisa Meyler.**",,2020-06-26 13:19:46,{},fw25r7y,True,t3_hg7fgr,False,True,t3_hg7fgr,/r/Coronavirus/comments/hg7fgr/parents_keep_children_at_home_despite_school/fw25r7y/,1593177587,1,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,,0,[],1593170386.0,,,
