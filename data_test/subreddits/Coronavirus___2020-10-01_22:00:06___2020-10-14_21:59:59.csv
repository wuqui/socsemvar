Dental offices aren't special spaces. They have no better control over the air than any other indoor space. The issue is that **all** indoor spaces are a risk right now, which makes mask-wearing extremely important. Because you can't wear a mask and get your teeth worked on, that presents an unworkable problem for routine dental visits.

Right now, there's a risk balance to account for that doesn't normally exist. Normally, the risk analysis is ""nothing"" on the one side and ""potentially find/avoid dental problems"" on the other. Obviously, go for your routine screening in normal times. At the moment, the risk analysis is ""significantly raise your risk of catching a potentially fatal or debilitating disease"" vs ""potentially find/avoid dental problems"" on the other. The small upside of possibly catching a dental problem before it's symptomatic doesn't outweigh the massive downside of potentially catching COVID.

I get it that you're a dentist and you think that nothing else is as important as your specialty.
