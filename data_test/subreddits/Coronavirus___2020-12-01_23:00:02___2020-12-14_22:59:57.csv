By your assumption, daily testing is now mandatory. It is functionally impossible for that to be done. So great, we’ll just close basically everything including hospitals, grocery stores, and anything that involves people.

We get what employer liability is, what is lost here is the nuance that this is incredibly complicated, and currently impossible for anyone to actually do. The stories of employees doing crappy things are important and they should be held accountable, often more severely than they end up being. But there are plenty of employers who are trying to follow everything they can to the letter but some circumstances make that literally impossible to do. How do we deal with impossible liability expectations and an expectation to operate for essential businesses (real essential businesses, not bars pretending to be essential)?

To be clear, I’m advocating for a global liability waiver, that’s asinine.
