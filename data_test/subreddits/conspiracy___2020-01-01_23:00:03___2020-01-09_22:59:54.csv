After 9/11...

&gt;Iranian president Mohamed Khatami and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei condemned and denounced the attacks and the terrorists who carried them out. 

&gt;Iranians who gathered for a soccer match in Tehran two days after the 9/11 attacks observed a moment of silence. There was also a candlelight vigil. 

&gt;Huge crowds attended candlelit vigils in Iran, and 60,000 spectators observed a minute's silence at Tehran's soccer stadium.


&gt;On Tuesday, September 25, in 2001, Iran's fifth president, Mohammad Khatami meeting British Foreign Secretary, Jack Straw, said: ""Iran fully understands the feelings of the Americans about the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington on September 11."" 


&gt;He said although the American administrations had been at best indifferent about terrorist operations in Iran (since 1979), the Iranians instead felt differently and had expressed their sympathetic feelings with bereaved Americans in the tragic incidents in the two cities."" 


&gt;He also stated that ""Nations should not be punished in place of terrorists."" According to Radio Farda's website, in 2011, on the anniversary of the attacks, United States Department of State, published a post at its blog, in which the Department thanked Iranian people for their sympathy and stated that they would never forget Iranian people's kindness on those harsh days. 

&gt;This piece of news at Radio Farda's website also states that after the attacks' news was released, some Iranian citizens gathered in front of the Embassy of Switzerland in Tehran, which serves as the protecting power of the United States in Iran, to express their sympathy and some of them lit candles as a symbol of mourning.

This isn't a simple matter of an entire country full of people being in agreement that they want to live another way. A group of people within that country want to run the entire country as a fundamentalist Muslim nation. Not everyone feels that way, but in a fundamentalist Muslim nation you're not exactly free to speak out against the government or the religion.

While some women are fine with it, may don't want to be forced to dress a certain way. Some want an education. Some people are attracted to the same sex. Some people are Christians, or Jews, or Buddhists and want to practice their religions without interference or persecution. Some people want to protest the government, or say provocative things about them. Some people feel strongly that the death penalty is immoral.

When you have a conservative, religious, totalitarian government in power, you'll have all sorts of issues with oppression and human rights abuses. Just because a subset (or even a majority) of the population supports these things, it doesn't mean that everyone does. And those people are not free to live their lives the way they want, and often find themselves in great danger if they try.

&gt;Everyone is differant, everyone has its own way to live life and its own rules. 

This is exactly the problem. There's very little room for you to live life your own way and according to your own rules in Iran.

&gt;why dont you just open your borders and let them live like you in your country?
