Yeah you only posted an article with the url `wikileaks-dr-fauci-sent-series-love-letters-hillary-clinton`, of course you didnt suggest that.

I read the two emails, sounds like somebody knows how to put appreciation into words. If this happened in my organisation, I would thank them for their praise and move on.

Like, what is your contingency plan if you get really sick?

Are you really that selfish that if you get sick you will put others at risk, such as essential positions like health care workers?

Your example is flawed, and I dont see how not wearing a mask makes it better.
