As a validation, our approach is also able to correctly identify parameters in simulated datasets where the true values are known (fig. S7).

So it's about being able to reproduce their findings. You are right that the best case scenario would be to have two exactly the same countries, one with and one without a lock down. As that is practically impossible, they use this method. This is interesting because it provides a different perspective and new information than, say, comparing countries with our without lock down but which are vastly different.
