After testing detergents, they applied inactivated samples *directly* to vulnerable cell cultures. That's a very high level of quality assurance - ""how can we make a biological sample safe enough that you could directly inhale it without getting sick?""

&amp;#x200B;

Two kinds of detergent solutions were effective, ATL and VXL. VXL contains Triton X-100, a commonly used detergent in biological laboratories.

On the other hand ATL contains sodium dodecyl sulfate, an unremarkable detergent that's common in home cleaning products.

And it appears that SDS was the active ingredient that matters. ATL contains another active ingredient - guanidium thiocyanate causes proteins to denature - but that ingredient was not effective when used alone.

These detergent-based inactivation experiments were done at 20C. **The detergent solutions were effective at room temperature.**

The heat-based inactivation experiments found that traditional, low-temperature procedures allow 10x more viral particles to survive than the researchers were hoping. **Low temperature only killed 99.999% of the viral particles.** Higher temperature was required to exceed the 99.9999% kill rate required for bio-safety procedures.

&amp;#x200B;

None of this was intended for home and clinical settings. The goal was to validate techniques that would be used to keep SARS-COV-2 or similar viruses contained in a lab. The conclusion was that some laboratory detergents are suitable for that purpose and some are not. A higher heat than expected is required. 

Cool study. Shit reporting. The most interesting part of it, IMO, is that alcohol made the detergent treatment worse. Public health advice has been saying this for months  now: alcohol sanitizers are better than nothing, but soap is a much better anti-viral agent.

I understand the economics needs behind all this, but this could result in a second lockdown not long after the first one ended.
