I get everything I want -all of Bernie's policies, and all of Biden's bridge-building social skills that Bernie lacked. Bernie never was much of a coalition-builder due to ideological closed-mindedness in Washington so Biden is an excellent alternative. If I get the policies AND leadership, I have absolutely nothing to complain about.

Biden has been very nice to Bernie and very much collaborative with him -something Hillary Cuntwad couldn't do to save her election. I noticed that, and that's a big reason Biden is going to win -he's not a unlikeable sociopath like her raggedy-Anne dumbass was.

Bernie Sanders lost because people preferred Joe Biden over him in a 1v1 match-up, and voted accordingly. Actual Bernie Sanders supporters know you're bullshitting when you overstate the issue because they are too pissed off about the political climate to not do their research. 

The second time around the great ''''sabotage''' was just the two other main candidates dropping out simultaneously of their own volition right before a key vote took place -that's politics, not some corrupt rigging.

The first time the rigging triggered reforms which changed leadership to remove Cuckie Wazzerman Schultz -who is from Florida, and was a Hillary cuck, and caused Hillary Clinton to lose the election (though the 30,000 votes were so close that just about anything negative caused Hillary to lose).
