The idea is that historically blacks/gays/asians (amongst many others) have been shamed specifically because of their blackness/gayness/asianness.  And so they're taking it back.  You can't shame them any longer because they know their inherent worth and they're proud of themselves.

So, just as you say people shouldn't be proud of something they played no part in, blacks/gays/asians are saying you shouldn't be shamed for it either.

White Pride being brought into the conversation as some sort of ""equalizer"" makes no sense, because historically whites have never been shamed for being white.  It's the same thing with ""Straight pride"", when no one's ever been shamed for being straight.

What it boils down to, is that privileged people think someone else is getting something the privileged person is not, and demand their ""fair share"".

The number of such scientists is very large, though many of them haven't gone public about what they know. Dentists are not scientists. Corporate pseudoscientists for hire are not real scientists either, regardless of their qualifications.

Yes, the idea is to reduce fluoride consumption because eliminating it entirely is impossible. The research so far has not found any threshold dose below which fluoride is completely harmless, so what is ""too much"" fluoride in drinking water is a matter of judgement. Anything above 0.1 ppm in the long-term is definitely too much in my opinion, but that doesn't mean 0.05 ppm, for example, is necessarily completely safe. On average, breastmilk is at 0.004 ppm, and can be much lower than that.
