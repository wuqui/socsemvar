They are the very start of basic research but what the lay public does not realize that the vast majority of compounds studied from this very basic phase of research fail.  They get screened out very early before patients are harmed.  My exaggerated example is the Bunsen burner.  It kills 100 percent of virus and bacteria yet even the average person realizes you can’t burn the virus out of patients.  However they don’t have clinical experience with other compounds to realize what a toxic dose is.  I even see some everyday health workers not involved in research falling into this trap and fantasizing about viral replication and mechanisms of action of certain drugs and prescribing them for Covid.  This is wrong outside of research and stop with the what’s the harm if the patients are very sick?  There is potential to kill more people.
