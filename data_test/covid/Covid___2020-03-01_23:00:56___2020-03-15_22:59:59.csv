&gt;I can already tell this is going to be a good one with assumptions on tone like that.


You're the one that started calling out for fear mongers while spreading misinformation. 


&gt;So you mean just like every other regional strain of the flu or flu like virus that the majority of counties deal with annually?

Remind me when a seasonal flu has threatened to overwhelm the health system with the sheer number of cases needing hospitalization? And the source for this will be in the part about mortality rate, don't worry.

&gt;So the entire world is only Asia, EU, and the US. More failed hyperbole and scare tactics. I'm very sorry you blindly believe the media scares. I'd really suggest doing your own research on this topic.

Don't twist my words, you started out saying that not most of the world was affected, I corrected you on it. Also here politicians are trying to tone it down, don't know what kind of politicians you have there that try to scare people.

&gt;We're around 54 cases, which are all quarantined to hospitals with no sign of any sort of spreading as per New York times as of Tuesday the 25th. Link: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/health/coronavirus-us.html

You've just got it and every country that is currently affected started out like this.

&gt;2% is incredibly low when we consider the main people who have been killed are elderly/older populace, those whom already have sicknesses or medical problems (As per the only person to die in the US from this already having medical complications), and young children who aren't able to get care or already have other medical problems.

Even then, I'm gonna need a citation on 2% and a breakdown of that number to show overall mortality rate vs age groups for it to actually mean something behind a simple percent designed to instill fear.

The victims were not only elderly and sick people as your politicians are trying to spoon feed you, here's an example
https://women.ncr-iran.org/2020/02/27/covid-19-infection-kills-national-futsal-player-elham-sheikhi-in-qom/

And as for the mortality rate
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/


&gt;That's an awfully odd way to tell someone their wrong when they posted this exact statement.

​I was quoting you, if you bothered to read what I wrote right after you would have seen I was correcting you.

&gt;That's an awfully odd way to tell someone their wrong when they posted this exact statement.https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/


&gt;Oh, so now you're saying it's even less scary than I had even implied?

​ No, I'm saying you're spreading misinformation


&gt;Did I ever imply they didn't?

Yes you did by saying that there shouldn't be such measures because in your opinion it affects only them


&gt; I don't think anyone was arguing that survivors don't have stories to tell. I know I sure didn't say or imply this.

I wrote victims. You argued that survivors had stories to tell. Two different things. I linked above about the healthy and young victims.


&gt; According to this article, it's very clearly not as bad as you're implying. Only 1 of 20 regions is hit hard in Italy, and even then it's a much smaller area than that whole ""region"" being affected. It's to the point where they're even telling people it's still safe to travel to Italy. Guess it isn't as problematic as you're suggesting if the overwhelming majority of Italy is still safe to visit.

That article is very outdated. Let me educate you since I live there. The number of cases is over 1700 now and it has spread from here to 14 different countries. The majority of the regions have closed schools, museums and so on. The soccer laguea has been nearly stopped. Many countries have stopped accepting tourists from Italy and are recommending not to come here, USA included as Trump brought the threat level of our country to level 4.

""“**This is really a serious situation and this is not a time for people to be living their lives as they usually do. Everybody needs to contribute now to stemming the spread of this,**"" said Dr. Bruce Walker, the founding director of the Ragon Institute of Massachusetts General Hospital, MIT and Harvard, which conducts research on immunology and infectious diseases.

...

“These are crazy numbers,” Jha said. “What this data shows us is without very aggressive action, we are in pretty serious trouble in terms of hospital capacity in eastern Massachusetts. If we take very aggressive action, open up a lot more capacity, really slow down infections rates, we have a shot at not overwhelming the system, but it’s not a given.

“**No matter what optimistic scenario you come up with, as long as you’re staying within the range of what is reasonable, even the most optimistic scenario says we have nowhere near the bed capacity to manage what is coming,**” Jha continued.

...

Rusconi, the doctor in Milan, offers this advice for Americans hoping to stem the tide of infection here: Stay at home.

“This will have a large economical impact, but **if you want to confine this infection, you have to tell people to stay home and force people to stay home,” he said. “I’m talking about work. I’m also talking about amenities, restaurants, movies, disco clubs, etcetera.”**

In the meantime, Rusconi added, he and his colleagues will continue to work exhausting 12-hour days at the front lines of the pandemic, “without drinking, without eating, with brief stops to go to the bathroom.”

“This burden has been very deep,"" Rusconi said. “What’s happening in four weeks or six weeks? We don’t know. Of course, we will need some, I think, psychological help afterwards.”

""From her home in Garda, Italy, Shannon Unks, a CU graduate and former Colorado resident, has a harsh warning for Colorado residents: “**Don’t do anything- don’t go to the cinemas, stay home, shut it down.**”

...

“**It’s a massive overload,” said Unks. “They have triage tents outside hospitals so if you and I walk in together, they decide: ‘Is Brian going to live or Shannon going to live?’ They pick the one most likely to live. They have to pick the person they think is going to survive the most. They do not have enough beds, respirators, not enough personnel to care for everyone.**”

...

“**Get the essentials and stay home as much as you can. Go ahead and stay home. Don’t go out to movies… bars or have gatherings in your home. Anything that can be put off needs to be put off. What you need to do is do not look at this as a vacation. You need to stay home.**""

**Symptoms atypical for coronavirus:**

— Runny nose  
— Sore throat

A runny nose and a sore throat are typical signs of upper respiratory infection. Therefore, those who have bouts of sneezing or get the sniffles likely have the flu or a common cold. 

As the new coronavirus generally affects the lower respiratory tract, most of those infected exhibit a dry cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia, but not a sore throat.",,2020-03-14 00:15:56,{},fkfxlxh,False,t3_fi1itg,False,True,t1_fkfrl7e,/r/rant/comments/fi1itg/if_you_are_showing_absolutely_any_symptoms_of_the/fkfxlxh/,1584145987,1,True,False,rant,t5_2qn2b,0,1584137756.0,,,

Os sintomas, no entanto, não são claros e podem confundir quem está receoso com o novo coronavírus. Como diferenciar as doenças? 

 A médica infectologista Cristiane Ribeiro explica que os coronavírus que já existiam respondem por cerca de 30% dos casos de gripes sazonais.

Saiba mais: [Governo do Rio Grande do Sul confirma primeiro caso de coronavírus no estado](https://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/coronavirus/governo-do-rio-grande-do-sul-confirma-primeiro-caso-de-coronavirus-no-estado-1-24296202)

— A diferença da gripe para o novo coronavírus é que a Covid-19 pode evoluir para uma síndrome respiratória aguda grave, principalmente nos grupos de risco como idosos e pessoas com problemas cardíacos e respiratórios — diz Cristiane. 

**Como fazer a distinção? **

A sintomalogia é muito parecida, por isso, a melhor identificação é via laboratório. Segundo a infectologista, os sintomas se iniciam com um quadro de febre, tosse, dor no corpo e falta de ar.

— A distinção é difícil porque as características são muito parecidas. O curso da doença também é semelhante, na maioria com casos que variam de leves a moderados — completa.

 **Prevenção **

Para prevenir o contágio pelos vírus da gripe e também da Covid-19, Cristiane aconselha hábitos saudáveis de higiene. 

— É fundamental manter uma rotina de limpeza lavando as mãos com água e sabão ou álcool em gel, cobrir o nariz e boca ao espirrar ou tossir e não compartilhar objetos de uso pessoal — aconselha.

A médica conta que é importante manter o bom senso para não superlotar as unidades de saúde.

 — O mais importante é prestar atenção nos sinais de alerta, como sintomas que persistem — diz.

I’m sorry people didn’t sympathize with your situation - however vague, because you’re not explaining where those comments specifically stemmed from, but it really still isn’t relevant to this post - and that you felt ridiculed while you were struggling. I’m glad you’re working to get a degree to provide a better life for your kids and I’m sorry others don’t see that struggle - but there’s also a lot to be said for not needing the validation of others and ignoring negativity when it doesn’t apply to you. 


However, the rest of your comment is, quite honestly, bullshit. 

There is *definitely* not a fucking hiring boom going on right now. You think the thousands of suddenly unemployed people can just go out and immediately find a comparable job? While we’re all being told to isolate and places are closing daily? You think telecommuting jobs weren’t already highly desirable for many, and are just sitting open ready to be taken while providing enough income for all *right now?*
No. That’s not what’s happening. Delusional. 


This is a *global* problem that is effecting *everyone,* but in the context of this post it is most specifically hitting the UNDER privileged - not just the privileged as you’re implying. 
Those of us who live paycheck to paycheck, who are disabled, who are high risk for COVID-19, who have other financial strains and crisis happening, who will face eviction/homelessness/poverty with a sudden ban on many jobs and options... that’s who these “handouts” would help most/be for. 
This isn’t fucking welfare - and if I have to read you type “welfare queen” one more time I’m going to lose my mind. 


This is emergency relief to keep life as we know it for *thousands* just in our state alone from crumbling, homelessness hitting astronomical numbers, landlords not being able to stay afloat since *no one* is able to rent, and the economy collapsing - or at least taking a dramatic hit. 


So, you hate being ridiculed, but now want to come in and drop the same bullshit you were so torn up about where it isn’t even relevant during a fucking pandemic? You’re despicable. 



And no, I don’t have a fucking mortgage. I’m on food stamps. I struggle to stay afloat every day. I work my fucking ass off despite being disabled and suffering through every day of my fucking life sick and in pain. If I lose my home right now, I will surely lose my life. It’ll be the end for me, and for many. And you know what? I’m not so hateful that I can’t also empathize with those who are lucky enough to own homes, and those who have mortgages, because they don’t deserve to suffer either just because of this virus.

In the event of the outbreak worsening, or a severe prolonged pandemic, the response will escalate, and the focus will move from Contain to Delay, through to Mitigate. During this phase the pressures on services and wider society may start to become significant and clearly noticeable.

The decision to step up the response from Contain to Delay and then Mitigate will be taken on advice from the UK’s CMOs, taking into account the degree of sustained transmission and evident failure of measures in other countries to reduce spread.

To ensure that the health and social care system is prepared to respond to all eventualities, at all phases of a potential future pandemic, the NHS/HSCNI and local authorities have plans in place to ensure people receive the essential care and support services they need – and sometimes this might mean that other services are reduced temporarily.

Plans are flexible to respond to different types of pandemics, ranging from a mild pandemic with a low impact on services (for example the 2009 H1N1 pandemic), through to a severe prolonged pandemic as experienced in 1918 (‘Spanish Flu’).

Similarly, potential pandemics are one of a wide range of risks that the owners and operators of our most essential services and systems plan for. The UK government and devolved administrations are currently working with our critical national infrastructure partners to ensure that these plans are appropriate for COVID-19, and that we minimise any impacts that could disrupt the daily services on which the UK depends.

The Ministry of Defence has put in place plans to ensure the delivery of its key operations in the UK and overseas. There are also well practised arrangements for Defence to provide support to Civil Authorities if requested.

The UK government will also step up the central co-ordination of its overall response using its proven crisis management mechanisms: COBR would meet as often as needed, bringing in system leaders to co-ordinate vital public services; and there will be more communication with Parliament, the media and the public. Ministers from across government will be designated to lead for their department on handling the outbreak, with senior officials and system leaders working intensively alongside them.

The respective crisis management mechanisms across the devolved administrations have also been stood up and will operate in very similar terms to that of COBR within their own nations, and all 4 co-ordination centres are linked up on UK-wide planning and delivery of the response to COVID-19.

There will be regular meetings between the UK government, and NHS/HSCNI and public health leaders, chaired alternately by the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care and his Permanent Secretary, to discuss the most recent advice from scientific experts and those delivering key services, and to decide next steps.

#4.3.1 The Delay phase – next steps

If the disease becomes established in the UK, we will need to consider further measures to reduce the rate and extent of its spread. Based on experience with previous outbreaks, it may be that widespread exposure in the UK is inevitable; but slowing it down would still nonetheless be beneficial.

For example, health services are less busy in the summer months when flu and other winter bugs are not driving GP consultations and hospital admissions. In the 2009 ‘swine flu’ pandemic school holidays significantly slowed transmission of the virus.

We will increase publicity about the need for good hygiene measures (hand washing, and catch it, bin it, kill it) and further promote the need for people with symptoms to stay at home for the full duration of their illness.

Other action will be considered to help achieve a Delay in the spread of the disease. We will aim to minimise the social and economic impact, subject to keeping people safe. Such judgements will be informed based on the best available and most up-to-date scientific evidence, and take into account the trade-offs involved.

Action that would be considered could include population distancing strategies (such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings) to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, while ensuring the country’s ability to continue to run as normally as possible. The UK governments’ education departments’ planning assumptions include the possibility of having to close educational settings in order to reduce the spread of infection.

We would consider such measures in order to protect vulnerable individuals with underlying illnesses and thus at greater more at risk of becoming seriously affected by the disease. The effectiveness of these actions will need to be balanced against their impact on society.

#4.3.2 The Research phase – next steps

It is possible that an outbreak or pandemic of COVID-19 could occur in multiple waves (it is not known yet if the disease will have a seasonal pattern, like flu) and therefore, depending upon what the emerging evidence starts to tell us, it may be necessary to ensure readiness for a future wave of activity.

The intention is to gather evidence about effective interventions in order to inform decision-making going forward. The UK government will keep emerging research needs under close review and progress research activities set out above.

#4.3.3 The Mitigate phase – next steps

As and when the disease moves into different phases, for example if transmission of the virus becomes established in the UK population, the nature and scale of the response will change. The chief focus will be to provide essential services, helping those most at risk to access the right treatment. This means that:

- there will be further publicity of advice to individuals about protecting themselves and others

- treatment and the requirement for medicines and other clinical countermeasures might start to increase, with the need to draw down on existing stockpiles of the most important medicines, medical devices and clinical consumables

- health and social care services will work together to support early discharge from hospital, and to look after people in their own homes

- emergency services, including the police and fire and rescue services, will enact business continuity plans to ensure they are able to maintain a level of service that fulfils their critical functions. 
For example, with a significant loss of officers and staff, the police would concentrate on responding to serious crimes and maintaining public order

- for businesses facing short-term cash flow issues (for example, as the result of subdued demand), an effective mitigation already exists in HMRC’s Time To Pay system. This is offered on a case-by-case basis if a firm or individual contacts HMRC about falling behind on their tax

- as NHS/HSCNI staff also start to become affected, and more seriously ill patients require admission, clinicians may recommend a significantly different approach to admissions. Some non-urgent care may be delayed to prioritise and triage service delivery. Staff rostering changes may be necessary, including calling leavers and retirees back to duty

- there could well be an increase in deaths arising from the outbreak, particularly among vulnerable and elderly groups. The UK government and devolved administrations will provide advice for local authorities on dealing with this challenge
there will be less emphasis on large-scale preventative measures such as intensive contact tracing. As the disease becomes established, these measures may lose their effectiveness and resources would be more effectively used elsewhere

- Everyone will face increased pressures at work, as well as potentially their own personal illness or caring responsibilities. Supporting staff welfare will be critical to supporting an extended response.

- We will implement a distribution strategy for the UK’s stockpiles of key medicines and equipment (for example, protective clothing). This will cover the NHS/HSCNI, and extend to social care and other sectors as appropriate.

- We will consider legislative options, if necessary, to help systems and services work more effectively in tackling the outbreak.

The UK’s health and social care systems will start to implement their business continuity plans, which cover:

- continuing to minimise the risk of infection to patients and those receiving care

- further identification of vulnerable persons to be supported
arrangements for the continuation of essential services, to maintain normal business for as many people as possible for as long as possible

- plans to reduce the impact of absentees during the pandemic
systems to lessen the impact of disruption to society and the supply chain

The UK remains in a high state of readiness to respond robustly to any disease outbreak, and our track record of success means that we can offer a high degree of assurance that we will be able to maximise the effectiveness of our health and care systems, and in doing so also respond effectively to the outbreak.

As and when we discover more about the disease and what, if any, impact its course has on the UK, we will provide further updates on how our plans are being adapted to respond to specific, changing circumstances.

The UK government is advising businesses to build their own resilience by reviewing their business continuity plans and following the advice for employers.

But sure, be misleading and reference only the second declaration.

Then there's now:

&gt;As the COVID-19 outbreak began, the federal government faced the crisis with a diminished capacity to respond.[222] After Donald Trump took office in January 2017, his administration had been slow to fill positions related to planning for and responding to pandemics. In April 2017, the Washington Post reported, ""There is no permanent director at the CDC or at the U.S. Agency for International Development. At the Department of Health and Human Services, no one has been named to fill sub-Cabinet posts for health, global affairs, or preparedness and response.""[223] The following year, ""the Trump administration fired the government’s entire pandemic response chain of command, including the White House management infrastructure.""[222][224][225] In late January 2020, science journalist Laurie Garrett attempted to learn how the Trump administration was planning to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. She reported: ""In numerous phone calls and emails with key agencies across the U.S. government, the only consistent response I encountered was distressed confusion. If the United States still has a clear chain of command for pandemic response, the White House urgently needs to clarify what it is.""[222]


&gt;Over the course of February and March, President Trump has: suggested that the outbreak could be over in April;[226] downplayed the likelihood of the virus spreading within America's communities;[227] declared that the virus would eventually vanish ""like a miracle"";[228] praised his own administration's response;[229] declared a vaccine would be available faster than his own health officials' estimates;[230] suggested that infected people can ""go to work"" and still recover;[231] and blamed the Obama administration for slowing his own administration's testing.[232]


&gt;President Trump told reporters during a news conference in India that the disease is ""very well under control in our country"" and added ""I think the whole situation will start working out"".[234] This came after Trump's comments earlier in February proposing a theory that the coronavirus ""goes away in April with the heat.""[226]",,2020-03-11 23:14:03,{},fk94bus,False,t3_fh1pab,False,True,t3_fh1pab,/r/redacted/comments/fh1pab/just_the_usual_bullshit/fk94bus/,1583976602,-3,True,False,redacted,t5_2rgii,0,1583961243.0,,,

Seriously though, there haven't been any noted cases of rodents getting sick with coronavirus, and it's actually been causing problems for lab testing, because it seems that rodents aren't catching it (so far).

Even if hamsters could get sick with it, it's actually more likely that you'd make your hamster sick, instead of them making you sick.  There have been some pets in Asia (dogs, maybe cats) that have been found to have coronavirus, but it's harder for them to spread it than for humans to spread it.  Usually it's spread by people sneezing or coughing and leaving droplets around, and animals don't spread those as much.

If you do get sick, with a cold, flu, or even coronavirus, then it's best to avoid contact with your hamster until you are feeling better.  If you do need to provide them with food or water while you're sick, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly before and after.",,2020-03-07 17:15:31,{},fjsxmf9,False,t3_few319,False,True,t3_few319,/r/hamsters/comments/few319/can_hamsters_get_coronavirus/fjsxmf9/,1583604911,1,True,False,hamsters,t5_2sjcj,0,1583594131.0,,,

[],,sigrid64,,,[],,,,text,t2_x5gj6gu,False,False,[],"Hallo echt irre,

meine Hoffnung zu einer Impfung ist überaus gering. 

Für Schnupfen ( auch ein Coronavirus) gibt es nix und bei Saars wie Mers gab es zwar Impfstoffentwicklungen, aber keines wurde eigentlich für Menschen zu gelassen. Es gab da Studien, wo im Tierversuchsreihen die Tiere bei Kontakt mit dem Wilderreger danach  noch viel schneller starben. Grad hab ich dazu noch mal kurz geguckt, aber mir scheint über die misslungenen Versuche über etliche Jahre will man grad lieber nicht „beunruhigen“.
Zudem mutieren Coronaviren nun mal schnell und die Adjuvanzien, die dazu gekippt werden müssten, sind grad da auch nicht ohne. Siehe Schweinegrippe. Im übrigen gab es wohl bei SAP  da ähm „Schwierigkeiten“, weswegen der Verdacht bei meinem Verwandten zwecks räumlicher Nähe so Großraum oder so ausgesprochen und bis dato nach meiner Information weder belegt noch ausgeräumt wurde. Nun ist er im Pflegeheim, aber da „der doch eh schon alt und nicht mehr so ganz klar“ blieb wohl kaum Spielraum. So ist das halt.

Was mach ich:

Derzeit sieht es so aus, dass Covid 19 kein Killer wie die Pest oder Ebola ist.
Wir haben Nachzügler noch in der Schule und arbeiten beide in ansteckungsreichen Arbeitsfeld, Heimarbeit gibt es da nicht. Auch ohne diese Erschwernisse würden wir uns nun NICHT zu Hause einbunkern, denn, DAS dauert viel länger wie „man“ so denkt. Selbst wenn das tatsächlich mit wärmeren Temperaturen abebbt, ist es im Herbst, Winter wieder da, sofern es sich nicht selbst anpasst und ungefährlich wird.

Also reichlich fatalistisch: Entweder übersteht man das oder eben nicht.

Vorsorge betreiben wir eh seit Jahrzehnten und der drohende Crash würde noch weitaus übler. Da kann ich es mir nicht mal leisten schon Monate vorher wegen Gehaltsverlust ins „Minus“ zu laufen. Klar bau ich Gemüse an, nur reichen wird das natürlich nicht. - Scherzkeks!


Sollte mein Arbeitgeber meinen, ich könne nach Pandemieplanung wegen der Engpässe auch ohne Schutzkleidung Klientenkontakt haben, werde ich das natürlich nicht machen und versuchen solches public zu machen. Die Chancen dazu sind nicht so viel besser wie in China.

(ÄHMM, so mal gaaanz vorsichtig: Vor womöglicher „Resteversorgung“ im Abtransport ziehe ich die Reißleine. https://schauungen.de/forum/index.php?id=26041 )




Ansonsten: 

- Händewaschen und sich nicht ständig ins Gesicht fassen!!!

- Türklinken, Lichtschalter, Einkaufswägen, öffentliche Verkehrsmittel  ect. sind potente Schmierinfektionstreiber und dazu muss man NICHT in den „Raubtierschutzraum von einem Meter Infizierter“ eindringen, wie das da grad runter gedimmt wird. DAS ist auch noch nach Tagen da.

- CYSTUS : Als Lutschpastillen oder Sud als Gurgelmittel oder auch zum Händewaschen. Die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass der ,da er die Proteine des Virus ummantelt so das die nicht mehr andocken können, hilft, ist hoch. Von Tee trinken, nehm ich eher Abstand wegen des Puschens des Immunsystems.

- Schlüsselblume: Bei trockenem Husten eine Tasse pro Tag seid Jahren in meinem gesamtem Umfeld bei denen, die es denn beherzigen, der Schlager.

- Weidenrinde: Urstoff zur Fieber,- und Schmerzsenkung  Klar hab ich auch heut gängige Fiebersenker da, aber je nach jetzt oder wenn der Nachschub schwächelt, durchaus nützlich.

- Dauermedis brauchen wir in direkt Familie nicht. Weiter entfernte hab ich schon vor Wochen aufgefordert, wie auch zum Grundstock an sonstigem Lebensmittel, u.s. , mal tätig zu werden, so weit es denn möglich ist.



Selbst der Hund kriegt ( wir „barfen“) zum Gemüse den ersten sprießenden Grünkram, u.a. zum Beispiel Spitzwegerich – Husten und ein paar Blättchen Cystus- hab ich im Garten nicht ohne Grund. Nachbarhund hat laut Befund Kehlkopfentzündung und röchelt rum, laut Tierarzt wohl der intensiven Mäusejagd geschuldet. Muss nix heißen, aber ich mach das eh jedes Frühjahr und vielleicht hilft es ja.



Und sonst so, sich am Leben freuen. Jeden Tag. Schöne Spaziergänge, das leise beginnende Frühjahr begrüßen. Pflänzchen ziehen – nicht in Sorge, sondern Freude. Lieben – meinen Mann, meine Kinder, Das, alles was da ist und Liebe zulassen. 
Kämpfen – kann ich eh zu Genüge.



Wenns dann doch schief geht, hab ich zumindest meine Tage so reich, es mir möglich war, genutzt.
Dies alles nicht wegen Covid, sondern eigentlich, weil so untergründig weit verbreitet die „Endlichkeit“ streift.

I don't understand companies who are clinging to their businesses especially when their services/food/wares could spread COVID-19 like crazy. I get it, you need to make money, but it's going to be worse when you are an epicenter for virus spread, and then you have to cover employee's medical coverage, clean up, etc. Wouldn't it be money saved to just call it what it is now?

If you're an average 20something, most likely, *were* you to catch the virus, you'd feel shitty for a short period of time and then recover–––maybe you'd never even know you had it!  There is a difference between being scared or terrified and taking this seriously.

My mother is in a high risk group: over 60, respiratory problems, has underlying conditions.  Taking this seriously means if I feel ill, I'm not going to risk exposing her to whatever I might have.  Taking this seriously means making sure she is being looked after, is avoiding crowds, has groceries and some extra bottles of prescription medicine.  This is all stuff the CDC and (maybe more importantly) Dr. Fauci recommend.

I'm not too much older than you, but i know 24 is too young to be terrified.  There's a very good chance that 2020 wont be a normal year; events are going to be cancelled, there might be some places in the US that have some spikes of COVID.  But please, please take a few deep breaths and remember that this is going to work itself out.  It might get a little bumpy, but channel that angst into taking common-sense precautions and things are gonna be okay :)",,2020-03-11 02:59:02,{},fk67uu0,False,t3_fgq2g1,False,False,t3_fgq2g1,/r/CoronavirusNE/comments/fgq2g1/so_is_it_only_affecting_older_people_badly/fk67uu0/,1583900040,5,True,False,CoronavirusNE,t5_2gqo03,0,1583888342.0,,,
