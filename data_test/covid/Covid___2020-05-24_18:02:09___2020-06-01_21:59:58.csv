I started playing DnD in high school with a group of friends, and we played several games for two years before we had a falling out. We made up and left for college on good terms, but by now we are all scattered across the country. However, thanks to COVID-19, my old friends have shown interest in getting back together online to play video games and whatnot.

I’ve been thinking about hosting a one-shot where we get back together and play DnD again, because I think we could have fun. BUT, I’m unsure if it’s a good idea because:

- Some of my friends have developed very different political and value beliefs than me, and I don’t want to get into a debate with them. I won’t, however, tolerate certain things that I now am disgusted by, like using the r-word.

- From what I can tell, my friends haven’t really changed much. I’m concerned they will engage in behaviors at the table which we did in high school, which now disgust me, like objectifying every female character in the game.

- I’m apprehensive about any past bad blood that might come up again, though admittedly they’ve probably moved on by now.

Since I would be inviting them, I was thinking that setting clear expectations up front could be a way to short circuit most of these issues. What do you think: is it worth a shot, will it be more trouble than it’s worth, and if I do it, how can I reduce the chances of problems arising?",,2020-06-01 06:55:34,{},fsi5e2u,False,t3_gqcoom,False,True,t3_gqcoom,/r/DnD/comments/gqcoom/weekly_questions_thread_202021/fsi5e2u/,1590994535.0,1,True,False,DnD,t5_2r9ei,,0.0,[],1590987334.0,,,,
[],,mtlmike85,,,[],,,,text,t2_1732g3,False,False,[],"There is never a good time to protest because it goes against a system. All protests have all happened during a bad time. 

Right now you’re saying protestors don’t care about the lives of others. This protest started because George Floyd was murdered in broad daylight screaming “I can’t breathe”. This is literally a protest about ending the unfair death of people. It’s a protest to save lives if future generations, and to end systemic racism. 

I have been respecting the social distancing measures in place and care for the lives of others. I see my family who are elderly so I won’t be going to protests. But I will speak up online, which is what I am able to do right now. 

You can disagree with the protests but understand why it’s happening. But if you only view the protests as a nuisance and how it will cause a bigger problem for people, without recognizing the problems that started the protest in the first place, and without recognizing that fundamental change is needed, I’m sorry to say but you’re part of the problem as well. 

People will never be told the time to protest is now. It will always be controversial. And I’ve seen people wearing masks on most videos posted over the past few days, which tells me they aren’t forgetting about the pandemic. 

It’s a shame this is all happening now. It’s a shame your president is too afraid to upset his base that he won’t speak out against the unjust system that needs to be changed. And it’s a shame that you are focusing on the lives of one group over another. The very people who are out in the streets fighting for equality are doing it at the risk of dying from COVID. Don’t you see how powerful that is? That they are putting their lives at risk for what they believe? Every single person in the streets right now is aware of this, and they are out there despite the risks. You are witnessing the greatest cry for help in decades. 

If you feel that something needs to change, but being out in public is unsafe due to Covid, then share the messages online. Sign petitions in change.org, donate to the causes these people are out fighting for. Do something. But don’t talk shit about people fighting for freedom in a country that keeps them down, and use the pandemic as an excuse to express your distaste for their fight. 

The motivation behind OP’s post is to shift public view and make the protests look bad, ignoring the fact that you have a never ending lists of minorities dying because they are a minority. 

I don’t want anyone to die, and I miss having real contact with people. For the pandemic I’m doing my part and being socially distant. For black people im doing my part and speaking up when I see others minimizing, ignoring, or being complacent in regards to their struggles. 

If you don’t know what it’s like to be a minority, and discriminated against, you are using a privileged rationale to try and understand an irrational situation. This is what balance looks like in a chaotic situation. The death of an innocent man by the police has led to an ongoing revolt. It doesn’t make sense. But neither does police officers murdering black people using excessive force when they aren’t resisting. 

Again, I’m not trying to dismiss the risks that Covid brings. I’m just trying to say that these protestors are fully aware of the risks, and are fighting to be seen and respected, and to stop being murdered.

Notice how you've ignored all of that, and reduced this person to one line that happened a decade ago in their bio, which has nothing to do with the protests or why they were killed (or the topic of this thread, which is graffiti during a protest). 

In context, it's even sadder because this was a person who repaid their debt to society, turned their life around, and became a family man, and then was killed for no reason.

Keep in mind that this person was arrested and killed not because of anything to do with their past life, but because a clerk thought they were given a suspicious-looking $20 bill and called the police. How closely do you look at the money you spend? This could have been you or me killed for no reason. That's why people are upset.

*Tue, 05/26/2020*

India will continue using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a preventative measure against COVID-19, after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) declared on Tuesday that the drug was found to be very effective with minimal side effects for prophylaxis.

The ICMR's decision was based on three studies they conducted, which resulted in a Friday advisory to expand the drug's use, according to ThePrint.

Speaking at a Tuesday press conference, ICMR Director General Dr. Balram Bhargava said ""COVID-19 is an evolving field. We don’t know which medicines are working and which are not. There are lots of drugs that have been repurposed for use in COVID whether prophylaxis or as treatment. HCQ is a very old anti-malarial drug that was being widely used and it continues to be widely used. It is safer.""

""We did some invitro study in labs and found that it has antiviral properties. This drug became suddenly popular when the American government also started using it and they got-fast track approval or emergency use authorisation. We also thought that it may be a useful drug for prevention of COVID,"" he added.

The India studies

Investigations were conducted by the ICMR at three central government hospitals in New Delhi, which concluded that ""amongst healthcare workers involved in Covid-19 care, those on HCQ prophylaxis were less likely to develop SARS-CoV-2 infection, compared to those who were not on it.""

The advisory also states that the National Institute of Virology in Pune has found in laboratory testing that HCQ reduces the viral load.

The ICMR also analysed data collected previously, known as retrospective case-control analysis, and found “a significant” relationship between “the number of doses taken and frequency of occurrence of Covid-19 infection in symptomatic healthcare workers who were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection”.

It further said “the benefit was less pronounced in healthcare workers caring for a general patient population”.

Another observational study was conducted among 334 healthcare workers at the country’s largest public hospital, New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). The 248 workers who took HCQ as preventive drug for an average of six weeks had lower incidence of the infection than those not taking the pill. -ThePrint

As a result of the studies, the Indian government will now administer the drug as a 'prophylaxis' to asymptomatic healcare workers in non-Covid hospitals, as well as non-Covid blocks of hospitals which have been earmarked for future Covid patients.

It will also be prescribed to contract tracers in containment zones, paramilitary, and police personnel involved in Covid-related activities.

Previous to the announcement, only high-risk individuals (including asymptomatic healthcare workers dealing with coronavirus patients), as well as asymptomatic household contacts of confirmed patients, were receiving the drug.

""With available evidence for its safety and beneficial effect as a prophylactic drug against SARS-CoV-2 during the earlier recommended 8 weeks period, the experts further recommended for its use beyond 8 weeks on weekly dosage with strict monitoring of clinical and ECG parameters, which would also ensure that the therapy is given under supervision,"" reads the ICMR advisory.

""In clinical practice, HCQ is commonly prescribed in a daily dose of 200mg to 400mg for treatment of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus for prolonged treatment periods with good tolerance,"" it continues - though it added a warning that it should be discontinued if ""rare"" side-effects such as nausea, abdominal pain, or irregular heartbeat are detected.

That said, the ICMR studies found nausea in 8.9% of healthcare workers, abdominal pain in 7.3%, vomiting in 1.5%, and cardiovascular issues in 1.9%.",,2020-05-27 03:56:35,{},fry0y8n,False,t3_gqesw4,False,True,t1_frwulqf,/r/news/comments/gqesw4/who_temporarily_halts_trial_of_hydroxychloroquine/fry0y8n/,1590558819.0,1,True,False,news,t5_2qh3l,,0.0,[],1590544595.0,,,,

Title: **Unemployment question. Did they pay me to much???**

Original Post: 

&gt; So basically I was off for one day due to covid 19 impacting shipments at a distribution center (Walmart). They filed unemployment for us all on hours and days we miss.
&gt; 
&gt; They sent me 365$ + the 600$ for missing one day of work. I make roughly 150-160 a day. 
&gt; 
&gt; Am I missing something?? I’m honestly sketched out by it.

If we talk about animacy then the problem remains. I'm not against dividing nouns into broad classes on principle, but the question is what function this serves. Everyone in your language already knows what a key is, so marking the key as ""feminine"" or ""masculine"" doesn't add any new information: it's a feature you just have to memorise.

It doesn't matter. Natural languages weren't engineered so they don't have to be 100% efficient or whatever.

I can only speak about my experiences as a native speaker of a language with noun classes but this is literally never a concern.

I _just know_ what gender a word is most of the time (and it usually doesn't even have to anything to do with the concept the word means itself, it's all about the sounds) and when I don't it's because it's a new word (like say, COVID-19) that I eventually internalize. Or don't, because these words aren't particularly common and people don't care if you say _o_ COVID instead of _a_ COVID.

&gt; But in those specific circumstances where specificity matters you can just use more words! I'm pretty diehard analytic so maybe I'm too biased. Imagine a keyboard which has all the letters, plus a button that writes the word ""insurmountable"". Why would you need that? ""Oh well in special cases it's quicker"".

[There's a comment in another thread saying that the cues increase listening comprehension](https://www.reddit.com/r/badlinguistics/comments/gprmoc/a_reply_disagreeing_with_my_youtube_comment_where/frpf7vj?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x), so there's another metric you could use that justify agreement.

&lt;EDIT&gt;
Also, like I said elsewhere, a better argument for gender, and the one I should have made to begin with is that it makes languages more resistant to noise.
&lt;/EDIT&gt;

And even if it didn't, a better analogies is keeping your old cables in your house. Most of the time it just takes up space but every once in a while it comes in handy.

&gt; Does that not come off as clumsy to you?

It's not what I'm used to and I think that most of the suggestions aren't aesthetically pleasing (except maybe &lt;e alune&gt;, looks Italian-ish) but I don't think it's clumsy.

It's a very natural way to extend the current system: as a rule of thumb things that end with -o are masculine, things that end with -a are feminine and things that end with -e (and refer to people) would be neutral.

Eventually that termination would even expand to a full fledged neutral noun class by analogy. Exciting stuff.

&gt; Except that natlangs don't work that way. They don't change because people get obsessed with the arbitrary path their language took in the past. 

Exactly, then why are you getting obsessed with an arbitrary path some languages took in the past?

&gt; People are not rational actors trying to find the best system ""for them"", people are born into a language and most people don't ever leave.

Yup. But this is a strawman, people aren't looking for the best system, they're looking for a system that's good enough.

And the current system works good enough for them.

&gt; Take English spelling for example. Everyone agrees that it's broken, but there is a 0% chance of it being fixed. Why? Because people like the way it's broken. They don't want to change, even if it would be easier for everyone.

Orthography != a language and I think you're underestimating the issue here.

People don't like the way it's broken per se, but there's a lot of things written in English that would need a massive overhaul, every speaker would need to take their time to get used to the new spelling and you'll either lose compatibility between different dialects or you'll end up with another spelling that doesn't match the way things are spoken.

Doing a change like that isn't worth the logistic and monetary issues involved. At best you'll end up with a Nynorsk / Bokmal situation and now native speakers have to learn two spellings.

We're not getting straight answers from whitmer, and she needs to be accountable for her nursing home policy (which as I'm writing this is still in effect). Instead, she sends the police to shut down a drive in movie theater less than 24 hours after it reopened.

With this whole COVID mess I’ve been out of school and working from home. It’s my final couple of weeks of school so I’ve been working very hard to get culminating activities done.

My GF has been laid-off and thus isn’t doing much but playing video games and DND with her friends and scrolling through social media.

I’ve asked her several times if she can do some more chores while I’m busy working (such as caring for our cats and cleaning the house). Every time she has agreed but I see no difference. I end up caring for the cats because their food and water bowls are empty every time I check and the house is getting quite messy.

Today I was working on a final and she was just sitting in bed doing nothing. I asked her why none of the tasks I asked her to do were getting done. She said she cleaned the cat boxes yesterday but when I was filling up the water bowl yesterday the cat boxes were disgusting and litter was all over the floor. I told her this. She basically just rolled her eyes at me so I asked her why she was being such a bitch. She immediately got very upset and left the room. I feel bad but I feel like she needs a reality check.

Am I in the wrong for expecting her to do a little extra, especially when she’s at home all day doing nothing while I work?

tl;dr. My son, 24 years old, and I live in the suburbs, he doesnt have a car and refuses to get one, and currently commutes at an hour and forty minutes ONE WAY into the city for his graduate job.

My son graduated in 2016 but soon after graduating, was injured in a severe accident and was unable to do much for himself for two years. Through physiotherapy he got a lot of muscle control, he deals with some pain, but not a lot, it gets worse when its cold. He pays rent and helps me around the house and I struggle with things, he demanded to pay rent so he could be treated as a tenant, which is fair enough. When he was unemployed, he was on Centerlinks Newstart and gave me half of it. Now he says 630 a fortnight, this included half of his food and all the bills. Hes not incapable of doing things himself, i just do this because i know he has almost no time.

Our problem is that since we live so far out, its hard for him to find work. Something that really shits me is that centerlink has a 90 minute rule, and since it takes him half an hour to get to the station it doesnt leave much wiggle room for finding a job. I want him to work, its good for his self esteem, but his irritability is getting worse and worse, hes snapping at everything. I want him to get a closer job so that he can be less pissy on a daily basis, so he can help me out with the dogs. Problem is he wont get one because hes a scientist, and all those jobs are in the city. His contract is set to end in a couple of months, and Im worried that once it ends, he will never get a job, because he can just say no everything at centerlink.

He made a promise to his sister to stay here and help me with the bills so she can move here and start a family and business, I lost my job due to Covid 19, im pushing 60, theres no way anybody is going to hire me, once people my age lose our job we get locked out of the workforce. When I ask him if he would consider working at target, he gets angry and refuses and says that he didnt work through injury just to be in retail.

AITA for wanting him to get a closer job?

**Article**:

&gt; WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary Katie Miller said on Tuesday she was back at work after recovering from COVID-19, a case that helped encourage White House officials to start wearing masks and take stricter safety precautions around President Donald Trump. 

&gt; Miller, who is married to Trump’s hawkish immigration adviser and speech writer Stephen Miller, said she had returned after receiving three negative tests for the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 

&gt; “Thank you to all my amazing doctors and everyone who reached out with support. I couldn’t have done it without my amazing husband who took great care of his pregnant wife,” she said in a post on Twitter. 

&gt; Miller contracted the virus in early May, raising alarm about the spread of the virus among Trump’s and Pence’s inner circle shortly after the president’s valet had also tested positive. 

&gt; The two cases prompted the White House to direct staff to wear masks and take additional precautions. 

&gt; Previously, despite admonitions to Americans to wear masks and follow social distancing guidelines, many administration officials were not doing so themselves at least at the White House, where testing has been taking place regularly. 

&gt; “We’re very happy to see her recovered,” White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany told reporters about the vice president’s press secretary. 

&gt; McEnany said Stephen Miller was also back at work after having self-quarantined. She said she did not know whether the military valet had returned and said she had no updates on whether anyone else on the staff had tested positive. 

&gt; Trump, 73, is in an age group considered especially vulnerable to the virus. He has declined to wear a mask in public and has stepped up his travel schedule in recent weeks as he seeks to get the country’s economy reignited from its pandemic-related shutdown.

[],,GeekSumsMe,,,[],,,,text,t2_3wucdj8e,False,False,[],"TL/DR. The inevitable result of a multiple decade assualt on science, funded by unscrupulous industry and their lobbyists. Interesting details below.

There is plenty of evidence that people, everywhere, are naturally predisposed to confirmation bias. 

What is different in the USA is that some have embraced this as as source of pride. We have President who popularized the term 'fake news' and routinely places any inconvenient fact in this category, even when there is copious documentation that the information is factual.

The same people have slowly discredited all sources of authority. The history of this is deeper and actually extends back to lobbying by tobacco companies. When scientific information emmered that tobacco was deadly, s group of tobacco executives decided to coopt the scientific process to sew seeds of doubt. They hired unscrupulous scientists, who focused on uncertainty, intrinsic to all knowledge and science as opposed to the many, many studies that documented the dangers of tobacco. 

The also paid people to scour newspapers and television programs and whenever someone broadcast anything about the dangers of tobacco, they called them and screamed about not showing the 'other side' and made accusations of the reporters being 'biased'. Interestingly, this is where some started to suggest that being 'balanced' was more important than being factual.

They also conducted their own BS science, so they could dissminate  their own 'facts'. The tobacco companies were eventually caught, but the damage was done.

This campaign was so successful in delaying public health actions with tobacco was used to deny: greenhouse gases, acid rain, and most recently climate change. The same 'scientists' were often involved in each of these campaigns. All were eventually exposed, but it was too late. Too many people had invested too much time in fighting against the 'establishment' that the seeds of confirmation bias was too strong for facts to overcome.

Media moguls ultimately saw the value in all of this and stared networks devoted to testing facts to tell people what they wanted to hear. They even coopted the same language originally used to spread disinformation. There is a reason why Fox News uses them motto ""Fair and Balanced"".

Ultimately, this led to Trump, who saw this as a path to the White House. Since being in office, he has continued to discredit the true experts, from Government scientists who he calls ""The Deep State"", to academic researchers who he calls 'liberal elites', to reporters who he calls 'fake news'.

The problem, of course, is that these are the only people who systematically try to separate fact from fiction, who spend their time conducting science to generate understanding. Once you've sufficiently discredited the only people trying to develop a factual understanding of the world, you can replace facts with   whatever else you want and then used the echo chambers of social media to bounce it around until people start to believe the false negative.

There are many problems with the culture that has developed from all of this. Our democracy is threatened by divisiveness, vulnerable to propaganda (e.g, Russian election interference), and the people are vulnerable to conspiracy theories as absurd as thins like COVID-19 being fake.

I've followed some of the COVID denying folks closely and their rationale flys in the face of any logical scrutiny. For instance, believing that this is a conspiracy, by every government of Earth and all the world's epidemiologists to get Trump out of office. 

The idea that the breadth of interests of governments of the world makes such coordinated efforts impossible doesn't occur to them. They actually believe  that these government leader would threaten their own political power, by tanking their economy, just to make sure that the lader of another country is not expected. They cannot seek out the truth because they have nowhere to go to find facts, so they echo unsubstantiated BS back and forth to each other, convincing themselves that it is true.

The interesting thing is that they açuse those of us who actually read the science, who go to fact checking websites, who spend considerable time trying to understand objective truth as being ""Sheeple"". 

Pretty scary, specially considering that estimates suggest that about 25% of people in the USA do not know how to differentiate fact from fiction, even if they actually decided that they wanted to do so.",,2020-05-25 20:36:18,{},frswru5,False,t3_gqfa9f,False,True,t1_frskov6,/r/AskReddit/comments/gqfa9f/nonamericans_what_will_you_never_get_about_the_us/frswru5/,1590442455.0,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0.0,[],1590431778.0,,,,

Every death is tragic. But what number would have been consistent with a “successful response”?

The US is doing better than Belgium, Spain, the U.K., Italy, France, Sweden, Netherlands and Ireland, and only slightly worse than Switzerland, when you look at the death rate as a per capita analysis.

Irrespective of all of Trump’s other faults and failures, what would have been a “pass mark” for his Covid response?

Also, would you hold anyone else accountable outside of federal government. Is Cuomo at all responsible for the comparatively high NY rate, ie because of his decision to move infected patients into care homes?

I guess I’m asking is it all trumps fault or do governors take some blame and / or credit too?",,2020-05-25 20:32:19,{},frswbie,False,t3_gqbvbp,False,True,t1_frrrdig,/r/politics/comments/gqbvbp/can_we_stop_pretending_trump_is_fit_to_be/frswbie/,1590442182.0,1,True,False,politics,t5_2cneq,,0.0,[],1590431539.0,,,,

This caused thousands of infected Chinese nationals to pour into Canada every day for months, ensuring the virus would become endemic here. 

After that, the governments that have voted to shut down the democratic process now, then took instruction from the communist Chinese controlled WHO to lockdown the country, destroying the national economy for the foreseeable future.

Next, ""Prime Minister"" Trudeau attempted to seize total legislative and taxation authority for the next 2 years. The opposition parties stopped his attempt to seize dictatorial powers at the very beginning of the lockdown, but never forget that he did attempt to do this.

Because COVID-19 was not as deadly as they had hoped, the governments that have voted to shut down the democratic process now, chose to move all infected and contagious patients into Retirement Homes filled with elderly people. Many of the elderly people got infected and died from the patients that were moved in there on the orders from these same governments.

This boosted the numbers by many hundreds of people across the country so it seemed like so many more were dying from the virus. But they were infected on purpose. This was a manufactured crisis.

The governments that have voted to shut down the democratic process now have been conditioning people by social isolation and now pressure to wear masks--further cutting people off from social contact, even in a crowd--are doing this to create a mass mental illness where people beg the same governments for their freedom back.

**Your freedoms do not come from the government.** They just promise to uphold them. But now they have chosen not to uphold them anymore. 

I hope they do shut down all through the summer so Canadians can see that we do not need such a large government at all. The only thing the government will be doing is controlling people more and more and making everything worse and worse.
