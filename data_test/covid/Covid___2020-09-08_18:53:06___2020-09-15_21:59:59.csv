Title: **Can my University target off-campus seniors and threaten them?**

Original Post: 

&gt; My University resumed (online) learning on the 24th of August. Since returning we have received emails and phone calls with photos of ourselves at off campus gatherings. We were never given community guidelines or student conduct regarding social distancing/ COVID. One of the gatherings was small and then more people showed up, myself and my roommates left. The other party was a set list of people and was outside with all state social distancing guidelines enforced. 
&gt; 
&gt; My university called students today and told them that if they did not tell them who lived there they would face consequences. Students are now sending in photos of one another and being scared into turning on their friends. They asked for address information, how many people attended, names of students, etc. 
&gt; 
&gt; Legally, can they punish us if they never sent out student guidelines or if we enforced social distancing at the gathering that we held?

I've played some co-op (the two pandemic legacy game) and jumped into gloomhaven solo (after buying ita year ago with a hope and a prayer I'd ever even unbox it), and done a bunch of reading on other solo games to occupy my time. You have a few that I've looked at - spirit island, Robinson Crusoe, this war of mine (played it on mobile, unbelievably depressing), too many bones, Sherlock, scythe, a feast for Odin, and Friday stand out. But so so many of these I've never heard of. Two questions:

1. How do you people find these games?! Is it recommendations from bgg forums, something else? I'm generally inspired by the depth of any hobby, and how much expertise there is to be had in almost anything. I felt like I had a pretty good grasp on what's what in board games, then there's 50 $200 Kickstarter games that have shipped in the last year and 100 excellent solo board games from boutique designers and publishers. Wild.

2. I don't think I have the time or maybe interest to dig into TTS or Tabletopia the way others seem to. Any recommendations on the best way to find my type of (solo) game? The little card games look fun, but I think I'd rather pick up a digital version on my phone for a few bucks. Do people watch playthroughs then try it out? What's the hit to miss ratios on your purchases?

I'm not expecting an answer to any of this, mostly just wanted to babble a bit and hopefully express how impressive this is. Nice collection!

I won't say that your friend isnt a Christian, but solely believing in God or that God exists and being a Christian are two different things. James 2:19 say, ""You believe that there is one God.Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder."" 

As Christians, we believe in God and that there is a God but we place our trust and faith on the finished work of Jesus on the cross. Everyone is a sinner but when people become saved, our outlook on sin is different than from before. When I became saved I didn't have a radical transformation compared to others because from the outside I tried to be ""good"" but now, as a Christisn, I'm convicted if I sin. It's not about how good I was or am trying to be, but because through the grace of God I became saved. When God sees me, God wont see my sin because I've been washed in the blood of Christ  and God sees Christ's sinless life - I'm forgiven. Being washing in the blood simply means that I trusted the blood that Jesus shed fro me on the cross. Jesus died on the cross and rose from the grave three days later.

All of this being said, Christians and I will still sin because just like the familiar phrase, ""I'm not perfect, I'm forgiven."" I prefer not to use that too often though because I feel like people justify the desires of the flesh and sins while saying that phrase. So yes, your friend or any Christian could do those horrible things and still go to heaven, but I would seriously wonder about their relationship with God.  Roman's 6:15 says, ""What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!"" If a Christian looks at sin as a free pass because they're saved, they should think on what the Bible has said on sin, what Jesus said and did, and pray. 

Heaven is a good place and someday I will go there but I believe that if God still allows my heart to beat and I have breath that I have a purpose here. I know a number of Christians who died and I still get sick as do my friends, but even though we know what's waiting for us when we die, we still wanted to stay and fulfill our plans that God has for us. We live in a world where sickness and disease is rampant. Because of the sin of Adam and Eve in the garden of Eden, we live in a fallen world. While we may get sick, it doesn't mean God sent the sickness (even COVID) but just that it happened. I don't know why some people die, even Christians who have a strong relationship with God. I don't know the plans God has for me but I know that God is good and that I can trust Him with my future and I trust in Jesus's finished work on the cross to save me from my sins.",,2020-09-14 15:25:03,{},g58n6w2,False,t3_isk5so,False,True,t3_isk5so,/r/Christian/comments/isk5so/will_christian_100_go_to_heaven/g58n6w2/,1600170033,2.0,True,False,Christian,t5_2qjy5,,0.0,[],1600089903.0,,

The study could provide a new understanding to tackle the COVID 19 patients and control the pandemic, which has caused crisis of unprecedented dimensions affecting every continent of the globe. Dr. Vincent Prevot, previously a principal investigator supported by the Indo-French Centre for the Promotion of Advanced Research (CEFIPRA), supported by the Department of Science &amp; Technology, along with a team of Indian and French scientists, have shown that specialized glial cell called tanycytes in the hypothalamus, as well as olfactory neurons, could provide an opening for SARS-CoV-2 into the brain. They have also shown that hypothalamic circuits could act as a hub for the numerous risk factors as well as the physiological effects of viral infection. This work has been published in the journal ‘bioRxiv’.
While COVID-19 has been considered a respiratory disease, many of the reported symptoms could also have a neurological origin. However, most investigations so far have not found the virus in the brain, or have found it only in the cerebrospinal fluid or blood vessels. Similarly, the only confirmed molecule that the virus binds to on the host cell surface in order to enter the cell – angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or ACE2, a molecule that regulates blood pressure, has not been shown to be present at high levels in the brain, other than in capillary walls.
However, the researchers were struck by a curious coincidence. Many of the functions affected in severe COVID-19 patients, temperature control, hydration, cardiorespiratory function, the senses of smell and taste were coordinated or transmitted by the hypothalamus. Besides, many of the risk factors for severe COVID-19, including male sex, metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes or hypertension, and even old age, also involve hypothalamic cell networks.
With the aid of funding from the European Research Council Synergy grant, the team stumbled upon multiple findings. Their bioinformatician and postdoctoral fellow Dr. Sreekala Nampoothiri found that both the hypothalamus and related regions involved in cardiorespiratory function, smell, or taste expressed the viral receptor ACE2 and the most commonly used protease, transmembrane proteinase, serine 2 (TMPRSS2). The hypothalamus and connected regions could thus indeed be infected by the virus, with ACE2- or TMPRSS2-correlated genes playing important roles in the perception of smell, taste, or the hypothalamic regulation of multiple bodily functions.
Florent Sauve, a French Ph.D. student and other members of the laboratory, found that ACE2, albeit at low levels, and TMPRSS2 were present in tanycytes in a part of the hypothalamus bordered by fenestrated blood vessels. Just as importantly, other cell types, including sensory neurons of the nose, which perceive smell, and their fibers entering the olfactory bulbs of the brain also expressed ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Thus not only could the virus directly affect the sense of smell by infecting these neurons but could also find its way to other brain regions, including the hypothalamus with its other crucial functions, bypassing from neuron to neuron along olfactory pathways.
The team also showed a correlation between known risk factors for severe COVID-19, such as sex or metabolic diseases, and the susceptibility of the hypothalamus to infection. The research team hopes that their finding will aid future studies to reveal exactly what cellular and molecular pathways are triggered by viral infection and whether they can be targeted to improve the outcome of severely ill patients.

I've noticed that it is harder for me to stick to my goals on my days off, usually because I am physically and mentally drained. I am too tired and unmotivated to cook something healthy, typically end up snacking all day, and usually go 400-600+ calories over my goal. I have noticed that meal prepping easy healthy meals to freeze for ""lazy days"" has really helped me stick to my goals. I can just full something out of the freezer, thaw, and eat. No effort and no thinking required! I'm not big on meal prepping because I typically love to cook and use cooking as a form of self care, but when I have days that I don't want to go to the grocery store or make a meal from scratch and calculate every little ingredient's caloric significance, having something to just pop in the microwave for dinner really helps!

One of my favorites is a combo of several veggies and turkey sausage. I put sliced sweet potatoes and grape tomatoes on a greased sheet pan and then put an oven safe cooling rack on top of that with a bag of frozen Brussel sprouts and chopped turkey sausage. I call it a ""double decker"" lol. I roast the whole thing at 425°F for 20-25 minutes, stirring half way through. I'l split this into 3-4 meals and usually add some quinoa to the bottom of the Tupperware. Freezes great and is really easy! I'll usually make it on days I'm feeling productive (in anticipation of my lazy days). 

I wonder if having pre-portioned meals and snacks would help you stay on target? Just like how maybe you packed your lunch for work pre-covid, in the mornings you could still pack everything you plan to eat for your lunch/snacks for the day and tell yourself that is all you get until dinner? Or, alternatively, maybe try a bucket of  pre-portioned snacks, like 100 calorie bags of almonds/raisins/pretzels/cereal/popcorn/etc. that you can keep in a drawer in pantry and you know that anything you grab out of it will be ""x-amount"" of calories.

The Mainz-based company Biontech and its U.S. partner Pfizer already see themselves on the home stretch, they intend to submit a drug to the authorities for approval in a few weeks. The tests are running under high pressure.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mainz-based Biontech SE and the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer want to expand their vaccine study in the USA. As the companies jointly announced, they have applied to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to extend the Phase 3 study of their experimental Covid 19 vaccine to 44,000 subjects out of 30,000 so far. This number should be reached next week.  
&gt;  
&gt;The broader field of test persons should also include younger people aged 16 and over. Persons suffering from virally caused diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C and B should also be considered.  
&gt;  
&gt;Biontech and its US partner Pfizer are among the leading companies in the race for a corona vaccine. Pfizer and Biontech expect to have results by October. If the results are positive, the compound is expected to be submitted to the authorities for approval at the end of October. By the end of 2020, up to 100 million units of the vaccine are to be produced worldwide, and by the end of 2021 around 1.3 billion units are to be produced.  
&gt;  
&gt;Last week, Biontech announced a cooperation with the drug manufacturer Dermapharm in the production of its potential corona vaccine. If the vaccine is approved, Dermapharm will provide and expand production capacities in Germany as well as filling and packaging. This gave the Dermapharm share a boost.

The Russian Foreign minister in a tweet said, “We highly appreciate an opportunity to discuss the development of strategic partnership in all areas bilateral relations, cooperation within the frameworks of SCO, BRICS, UN.” 
 
Earlier in the day, EAM met with his Kyrgyz counterpart Chingiz Aidarbekov. Both the leaders discussed issues of bilateral and regional interest and agreed to further enhance the Strategic Partnership in all spheres. 
 
The external affairs minister also met with the Tajik Foreign minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin and discussed growing bilateral and regional cooperation. 
 
On the Sidelines of SCO, Russia-India-China are expected to have a RIC group meeting also. EAM Jaishankar is also expected to have a bilateral meeting with the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The bilateral meeting holds special significance in the backdrop of the ongoing military faceoff between the two countries along the LAC in Ladakh.
 
 The Russian president Vladimir Putin also addressed the CFM through Video conference in the evening on Wednesday. The meeting of SCO foreign ministers is scheduled to start from 12.30pm on Thursday.
The SCO meeting will be chaired by the current Chair of SCO, Russia and the discussion will lay the ground for the upcoming session of the SCO Heads of State Council expected to be held later this year. This will be the third CFM meeting that India will be attending as a full member of SCO. 
The foreign ministers at SCO will discuss key international and regional issues in the context of the 75th UN anniversary.  The deliberations will be centered around,  “a number of urgent foreign policy issues as well as decisions aimed at further developing SCO activities on overcoming the global political and socio-economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said a press statement from the  Russian foreign ministry last week. 
EAM Jaishankar’s Moscow visit comes on the heels of Defence minister Rajnath Singh’s visit to the Russian capital last week, to attend the SCO Defense minister’s meeting.  The defense minister also held several bilateral meetings with the member states including Russia and China. During the bilateral discussion with the Chinese counterpart General Wei Fenghe the two Ministers had in-depth discussions about the developments in the India-China border areas as well as on India-China relations.
The Defence Minister had stated clearly that while the Indian troops had always taken a very responsible approach towards border management, but at the same time there should also be no doubt about our determination to protect India’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.

&gt; Aunque reportó ayer 217 nuevas muertes y un total de 70 mil 821 defunciones en lo que va de la transmisión del COVID-19, además de otros 4 mil 408 contagios y un acumulado de 668 mil 381, el subsecretario de Salud, Hugo López-Gatell, insistió en que “no hay duda de que la epidemia va a la baja”, con un descenso continuo desde hace siete semanas.   

&gt; Sobre el semáforo epidémico para la próxima semana, recordó que ya 22 estados estarán en naranja y ocho en amarillo, y expuso que de las 32 entidades, sólo siete no redujeron sus casos y que 25 están ya en fase de descenso en las últimas semanas.   

&gt; El PAN presentará este lunes ante la Fiscalía General de la República (FGR) una denuncia en contra de Hugo López-Gatell, subsecretario de Salud, y quienes resulten responsables, por las acciones, omisiones y negligencias en la atención y desempeño frente a la pandemia del COVID-19, y que sean constitutivos de delitos federales, anunció su líder nacional, Marko Cortés.   

&gt; De acuerdo con el líder blanquiazul, la denuncia se presentará ante la negativa del gobierno federal de realizar una auditoría externa por especialistas al manejo del COVID en México.   

&gt; Cortés Mendoza aseveró, en un comunicado, que el recurso establece que, a pesar de las recomendaciones de la OMS y del Consejo de Salubridad General, las autoridades federales, especialmente el subsecretario de Salud, han sido por demás deficientes y negligentes en su actuación, en contra de la vida y en detrimento de la salud de las personas.

&gt; We are further able to document national spread due to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally,

infection mitigation policies. In counties with the largest relative inflow to the event, the per
1,000 case rate increased by 10.7 percent after 24 days following the onset of Sturgis Pre-Rally
Events. Multiplying the percent case increases for the high, moderate-high and moderate inflow counties by each county’s respective pre-rally cumulative COVID-19 cases and aggregating,
yields a total of 263,708 additional cases in these locations due to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally.

(3.6 per 1,000 population, scaled by the South Dakota population of approximately 858,000)
