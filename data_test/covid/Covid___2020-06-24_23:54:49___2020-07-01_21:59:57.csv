According to the latest World Bank report released on Thursday, the Myanmar economy could actually contract by as much as 2.5 percent if the pandemic is protracted. The GDP growth rate for Myanmar was 6.8 percent in 2018-19. 
In case the world economy swiftly recovers and Myanmar is able to control the economic impact of Coronavirus, the growth rate may bounce back to 7.2 percent in 2020-21, says the report. 
The report says that it would be important for the government of Myanmar to have flexibility in spending targets and extending support to smaller enterprises in its COVID 19 fund and Economic Recovery Plan (CERP). 
The World Bank report notes the disruption in supply chain of industrial inputs and lack of access to labour leading to a contraction of 0.2 percent in the industrial production in the FY 2019-20.  Tax revenue is projected to decline by 6.0 percent during the current year. 
The COVID 19 will also have a negative impact on poverty reduction progress of Myanmar.

* New deaths: 0

* 101.3 average over the past 7 days (rate of 4.5 per 100K residents)
* Note: This is using the actual cases assigned to a specific day. I also exclude yesterday's data, since it's the most affected by partial reporting.

* Kent: 9 cases, 6.9 per 100K residents
* Renton: 7 cases, 6.7 per 100K residents

* Issaquah: 6 cases, 16.0 per 100K residents
* Kirkland: 6 cases, 6.7 per 100K residents

Fewer positive cases today, on a **\*much\*** higher number of tests. In fact, it looks like this is catching up on a bunch of negative tests that were occurred over the weekend but hadn't been processed until now. As a result, the % of tests positive number is actually averaging closer to 3.7% over the past week. The real number is probably a bit lower, now that it appears that processing negative tests is lower priority than processing positive cases (which makes sense to me).

**Fun fact:** If King County were a state, it'd be the 37th largest state (including Puerto Rico), between Kansas (2.9M) and New Mexico (2.1M). We'd have roughly 5 electoral votes. Thanks to /u/Seahawks543/ for helping to come up with this neat tidbit!

Ao mesmo tempo, no entanto, diminuiu a parcela dos que se dizem completamente isolados, sem sair de casa por motivo algum.

 A última pesquisa Datafolha mostra que a parcela da população que disse ter [muito medo do vírus](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/05/medo-de-contagio-cria-obsessao-por-limpeza-e-busca-de-sintomas-do-coronavirus.shtml) chegou a 47% em junho, maior índice desde que a pergunta passou a ser feita, em março, quando 36% disseram temer muito a doença.

 O medo aumentou junto com a explosão de mortes pela doença no país —em 20 de março, quando a pergunta foi feita pela primeira fez, o Brasil registrava 4 mortes pela Covid-19. Na noite deste segunda-feira (29), eram 58 mil vítimas no país.

 A proporção de pessoas que relatam ter muito medo é maior especialmente entre mulheres (53%, contra 41% dos homens), mais pobres (51%, contra 36% entre os mais ricos) e moradores da região Nordeste (52%).

 Apesar do medo crescente, diminuiu a proporção de pessoas que relataram sair de casa somente quando é inevitável. Esse índice foi de 18% no começo de abril, chegou a 21% no mesmo mês, mas caiu para 12%.

 Parte dessa queda no isolamento total se dá num momento em que governadores e prefeitos começaram a relaxar o isolamento, como é o caso da cidade de São Paulo, autorizando a [retomada do comércio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/06/paulistanos-fazem-fila-para-matar-saudade-de-shopping.shtml), por exemplo.

  A pesquisa Datafolha mostra, no entanto, que os mais pobres se isolam mais que os mais ricos. Entre os entrevistados com renda familiar de até dois salários mínimos, 14% relataram estar em isolamento total. Essa proporção cai conforme a renda aumenta, e chega a 8% entre os que têm renda mensal de mais de 10 salários.

 O isolamento é considerada a medida mais efetiva para frear o avanço da Covid-19, uma vez que o coronavírus é transmitido quando se entra em contato com secreções contaminadas, como saliva, espirro ou catarro, seja diretamente (quando se conversa com alguém infectado, por exemplo), seja pelo toque em superfícies contaminadas, seguido do contato com boca, olhos ou nariz.

 O infectologista Jamal Suleiman, do Instituto Emílio Ribas, explica que existe uma relação direta entre baixo índice de isolamento e aumento de contaminações. ""Enquanto a população não tem imunidade e o vírus circula, você vai ter um maior número de doentes"", afirma.

 ""Existem barreiras físicas que minimizam o impacto do baixo isolamento, como a máscara, por exemplo. E a forma como as pessoas lidam com ela melhorou, mas ainda há muitas falhas. Vejo muita gente com a máscara na orelha, no pescoço. Até brinco e pergunto se a pessoa está com caxumba [infecção que provoca inchaço na região da garganta]"", diz.

 ""O confinamento é uma [situação muito estressante](https://saudemental.blogfolha.uol.com.br/2020/06/29/sentir-raiva-na-quarentena-esta-associado-a-imprevisibilidade-e-sensacao-de-impotencia-dizem-especialistas/), e a gente não criou muitas alternativas para isso. E quem precisa sair de casa para trabalhar, pega um transporte público cheio. Eu vejo isso no hospital, não tem jeito: quem começou a sair de casa começou a se contaminar"", conclui.  
   
 A pesquisa também mostra que a maior parte da população acredita que os [políticos agem mal ao relaxar a quarentena](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/06/maioria-e-contra-reabertura-de-comercio-e-ve-piora-na-pandemia-diz-datafolha.shtml).

 A proporção de pessoas que afirma que só sai de casa quando é inevitável está empatada, na margem de erro, na pesquisa mais recente, em relação ao começo de abril, e representa a maior parte dos entrevistados: 51%. Um terço dos entrevistados disseram que têm tomado cuidado, mas que ainda saem de casa para trabalhar ou fazer outras atividades. Apenas 3% relataram que levam sua rotina normalmente, sem qualquer alteração.

 Com as exigências de distanciamento social, as entrevistas feitas para a pesquisa Datafolha ocorreram por telefone, com 2.016 brasileiros de 16 anos ou mais nos dias 23 e 24 de junho. A margem de erro é de dois pontos percentuais, para mais ou para menos, com um nível de 95% de confiança.",,2020-06-30 09:03:25,{},fwgidpm,True,t3_hijq0a,False,True,t3_hijq0a,/r/brasilnoticias/comments/hijq0a/medo_do_coronavírus_aumenta_mas_isolamento_total/fwgidpm/,1593507806.0,1,True,False,brasilnoticias,t5_3a1qf,,0.0,[],1593500605.0,,,

Pneumonia alone (which is a common complication of COVID) can fuck you up for up to a year.

I had pneumonia in 2014. It took a month post-recovery (I was hopitalized for a week) before I could breathe without spasming. Six months before I could do a flight of stairs without wheezing like an 80 year old with emphysema. I was in my late 30s, and had never been that ill with anything before. This was pneumonia alone. No flu or other condition gumming up the works.

&gt;Would you mind sharing, what exactly you are working on?

Unfortunately I can't do that because I only use a terminal created by some firm, I'm moving to Germany soon and I though I might find some opportunities to work part-time/full-time in the energy sector if I gain some knowledge about their electricity markets a little. But I can tell you, how it actually goes.

So, I'm mostly aware of ERCOT ISO(based out of Texas) and use a lot of predictive analytics to simply make money out of it for the firm. You must be aware of the Day-Ahead markets, so the task is to predict the occurrence of a constraint which is a result of congestion (which is in turn a result of unexpected supply or demand of electricity, failure of equipment, stuff like that) . So, during my endeavors, I figured it's actually easier to predict constraints based out of excess **winds**(when demand is less, off peak market hours(early mornings, late nights)) for which we use the data from [https://www.weather.gov/](https://www.weather.gov/)  (wind speeds, direction, hours, specifically ERCOT region) and bid the wind based paths (so far, we do the pricing manually but use the analytics to find the probability of occurrence of the constraint). As a rule of thumb, we figured wind speeds need to be at least &gt;14kts and demand from temperature related reasons should be lower for the trade to result in a profitable outcome. This is where we have the highest hit rate right now, trust me the firm makes a lot of money :P  \[Only use it for a Day Ahead\]

Coming to the **Temperature** point of view, again it's pretty much a similar story, we know where exactly all the nodes(not bothered about wind based nodes) are located and the firm managed to collect a lot of data already(they use the shortest distance algorithm and record max ,min and average temperatures both forecasted and actual from [https://www.weather.gov/](https://www.weather.gov/)), the firm also has an algorithm to forecast their own temperature numbers (which isn't that great rn I'd say :p). So we just try to figure which regions (by which I mean the nodes) are expected to see highest or lowest temperatures and put them in sinks and put nodes that are expected to see pleasant temperatures in sources and make a bunch of paths to bid for the following day \[ Only use it for a Day Ahead \]

And then there's the historical **Constraints** data that is being used, to use the seasonality involved. This actually amazed me like crazy, electricity markets are highly seasonal I realized, Covid fucked us a little but overall I think it's the best bet. We use a lot of number crunching, made all kinds of decision trees(loads of Random Forests) to find the seasonality of constraints and bid paths accordingly, so instead of worrying about tomorrow, we use it to speculate the likelihood of occurrence of a constraint(we check it for every constraint that occured in the last 10 years) in the next couple of weeks and we keep bidding it in multiple segments(from extremely low prices with very high MWs to a little less than breakeven prices with low MWs) for those couple of weeks, the firm loses a lot on premium but when they make money, they nail it enough to bid for an entire quarter.

RT constraints data with all nodes of ERCOT : [http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/contours/rtmLmp.html](http://www.ercot.com/content/cdr/contours/rtmLmp.html)I guess there's also a Google earth based map for ERCOT.

This may be true, but it appeared the article was written and they just wanted poll data to confirm it, which is troubling. Lastly, I’m a separate poll by this company, they asked the level of concern a person had with covid. Three options were given 1. Very concern 2. Not concerned at all or 3. Somewhat concerned. The majority of respondents said they were somewhat concerned. They never defined what somewhat concerned meant, but they took the step to say that 78% (combined the somewhat concerned and very concerned data). Well, I could just as easily say that nearly the same percentage isn’t all that concerned if I were to combine the not concerned at all and somewhat concerned together. 

While I think there are more people in favor of lockdown than I’d like to imagine, I’d seriously question this poll. It’s easy to respond to a poll saying that you’re concerned because that’s what a person feels they should say.

I remember being 5 years old and realizing that my parents will die one day and could even die while I was still a child. That was close to 4 decades ago, yet I still remember exactly where I was when that realization hit me, because it was terrifying. It's the single most terrifying thing to think about for any child, especially at that age. There's nothing worse than the thought of one of your parents, the people that you have the closest bond with and that you depend on for survival and protection, dying and never coming back.

If it helps her, try to explain that most of the people who die from Covid are older people, and that your family isn't in quarantine primarily to make sure none of you die. It's mainly because a) we want to make sure the virus can't spread, so that people who are more at risk won't die and b) having Covid is pretty damn awful and makes you feel really really sick for a few weeks.

If she doesn't stop asking about what happens to her if you and your partner die, tell her who she will live with in that situation. HOWEVER, that should be a last resort, since I know from experience that the worst thing my parents could have done when I was in her place all those years ago would have been acknowledging and engaging the possibility they might die. 

It's very important that she has this security that you're almost certainly not going to die. Just like how we tell kids that kids their age normally don't die (even though it unfortunately happens to a lot of kids, especially in countries that are less economically developed).",,2020-06-26 17:24:46,{},fw2yo1q,False,t3_hgb4ri,False,True,t3_hgb4ri,/r/Parenting/comments/hgb4ri/6_year_old_panicking_about_me_dying/fw2yo1q/,1593193511.0,1,True,False,Parenting,t5_2qhn3,,0.0,[],1593185086.0,,,

I studied biology with a strong focus in virology in undergraduate. I have a good understanding of RNA viruses and of infectious disease control. One opinion piece by an epidemiologist isn’t worth much. 

One thing that the opinion piece you provided  doesn’t consider is that the number of infections is almost certainly double or triple (more likely 5-10x) of what we are able to understand at this time. Obviously, the mortality rate is almost certainly inflated because of this. We just don’t test enough people. A virus that has only infected 2.5 million people in less than a year is a shitty virus and would have died off long ago. The more accurate statistic would be 2.5 million cases with probably 1.5 million to 2 million severe cases (similar to how the flu is reported). Think of all the young healthy people who were on Spring break or on campus or at work for many weeks prior to any real lockdown. Also think of all our celebrity friends who got tested and didn’t even know that they had it, thought it was just a cold. 

Data is what I work with on a daily basis, and SARS-CoV-2 data is very preliminary. It is rough and a true postmortem done by an objective entity will be much more telling (1-2 years away). 

On top of this: the reporting of this disease has become highly politicized and iffy. Some countries are likely under reporting and the US is over-reporting! You can die of a myocardial infarction at MM tonight and if you test + for COVID-19, you will be preliminary marked as a COVID-related death. New Jersey is listing probable deaths which is strange to me.
