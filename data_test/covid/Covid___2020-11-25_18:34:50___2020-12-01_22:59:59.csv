Hi,

I apologise for the form letter you're getting, but ever since the strike of COVID-19, this subreddit (and most others) has really been overrun with girls hustling their OnlyFans. That said, I am still a moderator of the community here, and that includes moderating out content that I feel doesn't belong on /r/bimbofetish -- in this particular case, your content falls under that definition right now.     
      
What it means right now is that I've removed your post and give you notice via this comment, and if I see a similar post that doesn't appear to have taken this comment into consideration, I will simply levy a non-negotiable ban on your account; I know this sounds draconian and frigid, but I really do not have the time to deal with the amount of spam that has been coming in without outright banning sex workers in general.

Basically, all we are left with is our imagination in what happened in those years since Lucas never filled in those gaps.  Sure, there were books, but the last one was often contradicted by the newest one, and was the major reason Disney decided to ""legend"" them.  

In real life, we all grow (mostly) but we also have setbacks and make bad decisions throughout our life as we are presented with new challenges we never thought we faced, just look at COVID where CEOs and owners of companies, mid level managers, your next door neighbor, family members, and everyone in-between are making good and bad choices regardless of their age and life experience.  

Luke was no different.  What made his character so interesting was how flawed he was.  The same with Han.  Was anyone really surprised that Han tried to save his own son, and yet still remain cynical about the state of the galaxy?  Did Han make the smart choice?  Since his own son killed him, I'd say no, but what made him attempt it was watching him grow as a person during the OT from a self centered grifter/smuggler to a hero of the rebellion.  

I think Luke's story is quite interesting in that it shows that people can have great intentions, but still make bad decisions.  Maybe he should have killed his nephew when training him, and that may or may not have prevented future events from  unfolding.

She actually came through a bout of COVID in October which was sort of scary for her. Anyway, last night we scheduled some time to be together. Originally it was set for her to come up and have some dinner and then go drive around for Christmas lights viewing. Well, she had already eaten so dinner was out but the driving around for Christmas lights was still on the plan. Unfortunately by the time we got out to see them most people in our area had them turned off. Headed back to the house and she was tired from her long day. Headed back to the bedroom. Now let me digress for a moment. Last weekend I had a new mattress delivered but we didn't have time to break it in. With as tired as she was I was still expecting to break the new mattress in but was almost thinking it wasn't going to happen until morning. About an hour, and a couple of orgasms later, we had broken in the new mattress. We both woke up around 5 this morning and had another go round and when finished, cuddled some. About 5 hours later, we did it again. Been a long time since we did 3 times in less than 12 hours. Go me! :)

&gt;Procjena analitičara američke i švicarske banke temelji se na pretpostavci da će svake godine trebati iznova procijepiti stanovništvo, kao i u slučaju cjepiva protiv gripe. Globalno tržište cjepiva protiv COVID-19 moglo bi vrijediti najmanje 10 milijardi dolara godišnje, procijenili su analitičari banaka Morgan Stanley i Credit Suisse. To će značajno potaknuti prihode farmaceutskih kompanija koje većinu razvoja cjepiva financiraju javnim novcem niza država. Analitičari su za izračun uzeli sadašnju prognoziranu cijenu od 20 dolara po dozi. [...]

&gt; Još optimističniju procjenu iznio je Evan Seigerman, analitičar Credit Suissea koji smatra da bi se godišnje samo u SAD-u moglo kupiti cjepiva protiv COVID-19 za 10 milijardi dolara. [...]

&gt; Stoga je to velika prilika za industriju koja je u posljednjih osam mjeseci dobila milijarde dolara za razvoj cjepiva od niza vlada. [...]

&gt; Moderna razvija cjepiva protiv tih virusa, kao i protiv gripe, a ona se mogu kombinirati s cjepivom protiv COVID-19. [...]

&gt; Međutim, u velikim farmaceutskim kompanijama vjeruju da će COVID-19 postati endemska bolest. [...]

&gt; Dodaje da će u tom slučaju u prednosti biti kompanije koje imaju već uhodane lance distribucije cjepiva, poput cjepiva protiv gripe.

[],,NursingPRN,,,[],,,,text,t2_4o7idqnh,False,False,[],"Good for you for asking this important question. It’s disgusting how older adults and seniors have been treated and basically left to the wayside for years now. It’s sad that these atrocities are really only coming to light because of the damage that COVID is causing. I’m really hoping there will be a major reckoning and serious changes made once we get through the pandemic.

There’s been some good points raised already but I’ll add some more.

Most long term care homes in BC (and Canada) are privately owned. This means profit margins are more important than anything else to the owners. As a result, there are multiple people placed in one room to maximize space and therefore profits. This causes a massive increase in the likelihood of communicable disease spread. It’s not just COVID, it’s also influenza and C. difficile. LTCs are chronically understaffed. Fewer staff means lower expenses and greater profit. To no fault of their own, there is simply not enough time for the care aides and nurses to provide adequate care to the residents. This results in residents getting the bare minimum and sometimes less than that. They might spend days in bed, unable to ambulate and lying in their own urine and stool. Staff are generally not paid a living wage and thus are required to work multiple jobs at multiple sites to afford to live. This is obviously not ideal in terms of communicable diseases where they can pick a disease and transmit it to just about anywhere. (Of note, staff are only allowed to work at one site during COVID - which only exacerbates the understaffing issue). There’s also insufficient PPE for staff. This means staff will have to reuse PPE between residents. The care aide may pick up COVID on their gown from resident A and pass it off to resident B because there’s not enough PPE to change.

The solution to all of this? Although not perfect, a publicly funded LTC system where people matter more than profits. More staff need to be hired and paid more than just minimum wage so they can work at one site. With more staff, there will be improved staff to resident ratios and more time can be spent on each resident to provide sufficient care. Rooms should be made at least semi-private (2 individuals per room) but preferably private with lots of shared community spaces where residents can socialize. More funding needs to be provided to staff on PPE and education regarding infection control and hygiene.

The other solution? Put more money upstream and downstream of emergency departments (EDs). Tons of money is spent on EDs because it’s the shiny object that taxpayers approve government spending for. However, it’s useless when we don’t have enough funding to transition these patients back home. Take a hip fracture for example, they come in, have surgery, stay in hospital for a day or two then get discharged because that bed is needed, not because they’re actually ready for discharge. They return to the ED the next week because they’re in too much pain/had a fall/have an infection. To remedy this, more money needs to be put towards hiring home care nurses that can help with wound and medical device care, occupational therapists to help with the individual in their own home, and physiotherapists to help with flexibility, mobility, and strength. More money also needs to be spent on family doctors so that individuals avoid unnecessary visits to the ED where they don’t get the same continuity of care.

These are only a few ideas and many more will be needed to create a system where older adults can live high quality lives in their later years and pass away with some dignity.",,,2020-11-28 18:28:38,{},gdwiife,False,t3_k2oagx,False,False,t3_k2oagx,/r/vancouver/comments/k2oagx/how_do_we_better_protect_the_elderly/gdwiife/,1606590374,6,True,False,vancouver,t5_2qhov,,0,[],1606580918.0,,,

The attempts to ""restrict"" and ""lock down"" the province seem to be ""compromises"" between the ""economy"" and ""health""... except it's basically the worst of both worlds for most people.  Businesses are struggling, yet cases are remaining high.

People are getting burnt out and are ignoring the guidelines because of the inconsistency in the province's messaging.

Backstory : my husband (31M) and I (29F) live in an area of the US that was hit very hard by covid. Our gyms, restaurants, non-essential businesses were closed for many months. I have an underlying health condition that makes me very high risk for having covid complications - we have definitely been more cautious than others and have luckily been working remote and safe this whole time.

My husband likes working out and goes to the gym regularly. When everything was shut down he did home workouts and running. When gyms reopened we both went back eventually to our workout routines. with cases going up significantly in our area, I froze my membership again. I sat him down and said to him I didn’t want to start a fight but asked him to take a break for 2 weeks, with so many people gathering for thanksgiving, I anticipate cases going up and there being a resurge, so taking a break just to be safe. He flew off the handle , telling me I am trying to control him and in 2 weeks I’ll ask him not to go back. My argument is I am not trying to manipulate or control him at all I’m asking him to think of his wife who would get very ill from covid. 

Few points
1) I don’t like his gym, the owner doesn’t take proper safety precautions, and is suing our local government to be allowed to operate at full capacity. My husband knows my fears about this but says I need to trust that he is being safe. He uses the fact that I don’t like the gym owner as my reason for asking him not to go to the gym, not the actual reason of covid 
2) my husband said I keep him from the gym, but they were closed for several months that wasn’t my fault - when they reopened he even didn’t go back right away because he said the gym wasn’t being safe 
3) we have multiple different gym equipment items in our home he can use (weights, machines, etc)
4) he says he uses the gym as socialization and I am trying to keep him home with him - which isn’t the case we do our own thing at home I don’t need him home with me at all 

I don’t want him to not have an outlet to exercise or de-stress, but I would also like to not live 

TL;DR: i asked my husband to stay home from the gym for 2 weeks because I am in a high risk category for covid , he flew off the handle and now we aren’t speaking.

&gt;
&gt;Women's wages going up in comparison to male wages is a good thing, it's making things better and more fair and literally not a problem.

Yeah that's good reasoning showing why the conclusion is wrong, but it doesn't change the fact that I used the same logic and got to the opposite conclusion.

Let me do a closer analogy where you don't have to reverse the axis:

According to the article, Japan ""is not caring about women"" and from the title ""women have been impacted most"" because their suicide rates are rising faster, right? That's the logic.  Well let's say that rates of women catcalling men is rising faster than women catcalling men, would that mean recent decades of feminism efforts ""is not caring about men"" and ""men have been impacted most by catcalling/feminism""?  Of course not, because as you will rightly point out catcalling happens more to women and if you're going to compare men and women, that's the most important thing.  Swap catcalling for sexual assault or rape and it's the same thing.

&gt;While suicides going up IS a problem. That male suicides are high doesn't negate the fact female suicides are rising.

It does negate the title of the article ""In Japan, more people died from suicide last month than from Covid in all of 2020. ~~And women have been impacted most~~ *And vast majority of those deaths were men*""

That's how it should be

Wheres the CNN article calling people to action against the problem of male suicide rates?... Doesn't exist.

Do you agree that male suicide is a 2.5x more important than female suicide?  Any answer other than yes, and you're a sexist who cares more about female lives than male.  Do you agree catcalling women is a more important issue than catcalling men?  In anticipation of you saying they're equally important when clearly one is more important than the other why the fuck are there both more articles about women being catcalled AND women's suicide?",,,2020-11-29 18:49:37,{},ge2clx2,False,t3_k317t9,False,True,t1_ge1y3vz,/r/news/comments/k317t9/in_japan_more_people_died_from_suicide_last_month/ge2clx2/,1606678771,1,True,False,news,t5_2qh3l,,0,[],1606668577.0,,,
