&gt; The epidemic began in Hubei&amp;#039;s capital, Wuhan, and has since spread to more than two dozen countries.

&gt; Japan&amp;#039;s health ministry announced Thursday that 44 more people on a cruise ship quarantined in the port of Yokohama, near Tokyo, have tested positive for COVID-19.

All nine patients had a caesarean section in their third trimester. Seven patients presented with a fever. Other symptoms, including cough (in four of nine patients), myalgia (in three), sore throat (in two), and malaise (in two), were also observed. Fetal distress was monitored in two cases. Five of nine patients had lymphopenia (&lt;1·0 × 10⁹ cells per L). Three patients had increased aminotransferase concentrations. None of the patients developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia or died, as of Feb 4, 2020. Nine livebirths were recorded. No neonatal asphyxia was observed in newborn babies. All nine livebirths had a 1-min Apgar score of 8–9 and a 5-min Apgar score of 9–10. Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swab, and breastmilk samples from six patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, and all samples tested negative for the virus.

There is an article regarding this, which has been criticized for a number of reasons. People have been skeptical, and questioned whether there is a difference in ACE2 genetics in Asia vs. World populations.

There, however, are ethnically clustered ACE2 polymorphisms, which were discovered in hypertension research.  Here is an academic paper, in Nature (with an n=633,) discussing [Association of ACE2 genetic polymorphisms with hypertension-related target organ damages in south Xinjiang](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41440-018-0166-6)

&gt;The ACE2 gene exhibits a high degree of genetic polymorphism. Unlike the association of ACE2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with EH in Europeans (rs2074192, rs233575, and rs2158083) [11], Australians (rs1978124 and rs2285666) [12], Indians (rs2285666) [13] and Koreans (rs1514282 and rs1514283) [14], **ACE2 polymorphisms associated with EH in the Chinese population display considerable diversity between inhabitants of southern vs. northern China, Han vs. non-Han nationality, and between females and** ***males.*** A meta-analysis of ACE2 gene polymorphism and EH association confirmed rs2285666 and rs2106809 were correlated with hypertension risk in persons of Han descent

There are direct and authoritative studies regarding population genetics and viral transmission, with specific regard to Interferon-induced transmembrane proteins. Here is a paper which specifically talks about the expression of different gene variants in Europe vs. East Asia. There can be 30% higher rates of particular gene expressions, in differing continent's populations, which influence specific Influenza viruses susceptibility, for example.

(TL;DR have there been large enough scale genetic/epigenetic studies on ACE2 or other genetic variations in connection with ethnic variability?

“It’s worrying because there a lot of people moving around and a lot of tourists coming into the country from all parts of the world,” Patricia Guttman, a municipal health official, told Reuters.
Guttman said the city had freed up some 120 hospital beds that could be used for suspected coronavirus patients. Rio is already gearing up for the celebrations, which take place this year between Feb. 21 and Feb. 26.

During Carnival, hundreds of thousands of visitors parade through the sweltering seaside streets of Rio. In practice, many of the celebrations often include a dearth of clothing and a surplus of alcohol, creating a ripe environment for contagious disease.

So far, South America has not had any confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus. Thirty four Brazilians evacuated from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, are being held in quarantine at a military base.

On Wednesday, Rio health workers received training on how to identify a potential carrier of the virus. They also practiced quickly applying face masks to potential patients, while themselves slipping into protective plastic suits.
City officials insist they are prepared.

“We’re ready for Carnival,” Guttman said.

Even if testing could discern CoVID-2019, it doesn't yet seem clear yet what treatments are available and effective for mitigation in the early stages. 

I do understand how impractical and expensive it would be to treat every potential case as though it were CoVID-2019 in the absence of testing. However, I can also imagine being a patient and feeling that being told as much is unacceptable.

From the public health perspective, the time is now if we are to do anything to keep this disease from gaining traction. Misdiagnosing potential cases with influenza and sending them out into the world to continue shedding and infecting others seems at best a missed opportunity and at worst a recipe for disaster. 

Perhaps sending patients that present with CoVID-2019 type, lower-respiratory symptoms home to self-quarantine for at least two weeks would be a start. This of course would include a multitude of people without CoVID-2019. It would be a drastic measure to undertake, let alone enforce. 

However, it might be at least one way to stem the spread while we wait for wider testing distribution and implementation. Anything seems better than nothing at this point.

Again as you said, and I agree the real solution is testing capacity and accessibility.  I hope we have our best working on it.

Again, you are making a bad comparison. We *do not yet know* the mortality rate of Covid-19 and thus we can't properly compare it to SARS which, after the epidemic, is now a known quantity. This is where you continue to miss the point: Covid-19 still has an unknown risk profile, something that the WHO themselves are warning about.

Sequence similarity---how similar the sequence of DNA letters is to something else we already know is viral. The first step is usually to use the [BLAST (Basic Alignment Search Tool)](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) tool. That'll give you a decent idea of what a sequence is. After that, using sequences to make [phylogenetic trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree) will give you a more detailed picture. People are using these methods right now to figure where the novel coronovirus (now called COVID-19) came from and (how it's evolving)[http://virological.org/]. 

&gt; I have heard the claim that humans have some odd 2-8% viral DNA 

If you count [transposons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon), it's actually about half the human genome.

Second, the fact that this is a new disease, makes handling the situation much harder. 

If it eventually becomes clear that COVID-19 can't be contained, the strategy changes a lot - instead of everybody with a mild fever and a cough being tested, resources would be saved to treat the severe cases, while the rest sits at home and slurps soup.

That also hopefully brings down the number of hospital-acquired cases and in turn lowers the mortality rate, as those who actually have influenza aren't picking Corona up in the ER.

Quarantines might still be necessary in some places, but not to the extent that you have in Wuhan, as they are still hoping to contain it.
