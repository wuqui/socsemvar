Sure for Partey, being what, 26 or 27, he probably still remembers the glory Wenger years  and there is some attachment from admiration, even maybe fandom because of that. But history only gets you so far. Liverpool fans found out the hard way. United fans pre-90s too, and in another few years, currently now. If Arterta doesn't win something of note, ie: CL or EPL, I dare say EL too, but given Arsenal fans see themselves as beyond it, I won't, a whole new generation will grow up not seeing Arsenal as an elite club. History only matters so much. But again, location and wages offered is a neutralizer. Ultimately, if not for COVID, and Thiago wanting to move, Aouar would be at Liverpool or Juventus now.

[],,ssfahrer,,,[],,,,text,t2_6fa95oo8,False,False,[]," Someone in the US catches bubonic plague 

When was the last time the US even had anything close to an ""accidental"" exposure to bubonic plague? According to the CDC, there was ONE CASE in the US in 2018 (see [https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html)). This argument is very flawed -- at best. 

Why didn't you at least use the ""disease du jour"" -- COVID-19 (for which, IMO, the US may be using -- and rightly so -- to reduce our OVERPOPULATION, particularly the overpopulation of those aged 65+, who by and large are ""takers""  -- in the Mitt Romney sense -- rather than PRODUCERS.) While the Left is (hypocritically IMO) worrying about a ""super spreader"" event at 'The Villages' in FL, they would also admit (under their breath) that if more REPUBLICANS die of COVID, it would be easier for THEM (and the Democrats) to not only win FL, but every other state in this once great nation. 

Your overall question is a bit silly: even if you want to compare ""deaths due to Communist policies"" vs ""deaths due to Capitalist policies"" per year per nation (since the simple totaling of aggregate deaths in Communist nations vs aggregate deaths in Capitalist nations -- even if you could figure out such a statistic-- is a flawed statistic since a\] more Capitalist nations can equal more 'Capitalist' deaths simply by chance, b\] more YEARS of such Capitalist nations can equal more deaths even if there is a low death rate per year in those nations). However, preliminary results would suggest that capitalism has allowed for ""the greatest good for the greatest number"" (as opposed to Communist or Socialist nations) -- to the point where the world itself has too many numbers of people: as an American, I'll refer to that nation FIRST.

Americans need to be honest with themselves:: 300 million Americans is many millions too many to be a sustainable amount of people, especially since we have to ""rape the world"" (such 'resource exploitation' is often cited as an excuse by the Left to explain much of the ""illegal immigration"" flowing from Central and South America, for example, to the US which contributes to the population increase) in order to feed all those mouths. 

The nations of the world (not just the US) SHOULD have been using this COVID crisis to get rid of their overpopulation crises \[for example, the presence of over 1 BILLION people in both China and India, which is an obscene amount of humans for the entire planet, much less two nations\]-- but no one dares admit the truth: the only REAL problem with CAPITALISM is that it has allowed the OVERPRODUCTION OF (during the 1920s, goods, and more recently) HUMANS: problems which would never exist in a Communist nation (since they deliberately remove any incentives to produce much of anything). Perhaps a decade or two of Communism might remedy that overproduction problem (be it of goods OR humans), but the problem with communism is that the Communist leaders wouldn't let go of power when the overpopulation or overproduction problems caused by capitalism is relieved -- leading to both excess productive capacity going to waste AND a LACK of humans who would be able to consume that production: the two major ""sins"" of Communism in most truly communist nations (BTW, China is far too NATIONALISTIC to be truly Communist -- it's Socialism is more like NATIONAL SOCIALISM than Communism which is anti-nationalistic at its core. Remember that true Communism implies that there is no such thing as a 'nation' for the proletarian worker under capitalism: and there is no way for such a proletarian to become a member of a ""nation"" since no nation can ever be defined by its proletarians....",,,2020-10-12 19:01:50,{},g8m9bt3,False,t3_j9p6yc,False,True,t3_j9p6yc,/r/CapitalismVSocialism/comments/j9p6yc/capitalists_how_come_capitalism_has_never_killed/g8m9bt3/,1602532078,1,True,False,CapitalismVSocialism,t5_3cct3,,0.0,[],1602522110.0,,,,

Big rant and feeling sorry for myself ahead...You may want to skip it. 

I came into the year doing great! Locked into my keto diet, losing weight and it reduced my stomach issues... I was feeling positive about life and the future. 

I have a physical disability (spine and nerve damage) and I was doing well to follow my daily PT exerciaes and walking around the neighborhood. Baby steps, but I was being consistent. 

All of this made me happier and my relationships were benefitting from it as well. Life was good, especially given my intractable pain and limitations. 

The pandemic threw me for a loop and I have been reeling ever since. I have gained back 15lbs and developed new health issues that have set me back 5 steps from where I was in Feb.

It terrifies me as my daughter has a severe immunodeficiency. She has to do daily sailene infusions and twice weekly plasma antibody infusions. 

She lives at home and we went into a rigid, prolonged quarantine mode as she will not be safe from this until she can regularly receive covid antibodies in her plasma infusions. We are expecting another 18-24mos minimum until that time. It is overwhelming. 

To add to the general insanity that is 2020...I developed a never-ending migraine and vision problems in Aug. This is due to my spinal column being compressed and building intracranial pressure. So it is not really a migraine, just feels like it every day. Surgery on the horizon for me. 

I feel like all of this has broken me. It has broken me. 

I typically deal with each new crisis and health problem and we keep soldiering on, but my constant pain for the last decade has worn me down and it has been really hard coming to grips with this new challenge on top of the pandemic. 

I hope I am close to getting back on track. I made it through today without eating sweets. First day in a week. I have got to reinstate my discipline and get my shit back together. 

I joined several new subs to help in that regard and am going to do my level best.  So ya, this year has really gotten to me.

Accordingly, anybody the Leafs have signed who is earning $1,075,000 or less does not count against the cap. The Leafs have to pay them of course (and without escrow and salary deferment on those not on the NHL roster.) but in terms of cap impact? None at all.
