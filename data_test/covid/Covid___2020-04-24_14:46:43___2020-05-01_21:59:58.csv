Et oplagt element, som ikke bliver adresseret af den flok, der griber efter halmstrå for at fastholde deres manglende accept af historiske fakta, er, at de afdøde fra COVID-19, bliver kremeret i kister, hvilket ikke var tilfældet i Auschwitz. Dette muliggør, som rapporten beskriver, at der bliver brændt flere lig på samme tid. 


Noget andet er forskellen i operationsmønstre. Ovnene i Auschwitz kunne i perioder være i næsten kontinuerlig brug. Modsat hvad man skulle tro, øgede det faktisk ovnenes levetid:


&gt; It is interesting to note that the instructions for both the Gusen and Auschwitz ovens suggest that continued use at an even temperature will actually prolong the useful life of the ovens. On the same day that the Gusen instructions were issued, two Topf engineers stated that the Topf double muffle furnace could incinerate 60 to 72 bodies [30 to 36 per muffle] in a 20 hour period with three hours of maintenance required. [133]


Derudover blev ikke alle ofrene i Auschwitz blev kremeret i ovnene - en delblev også brændt i åbne ildsteder, herunder i forbindelsen med aktionen mod de 400.000 ungarnske jøder (som benægtere sjovt nok ikke lige kan redegøre for hvor forsvandt hen).",,2020-05-01 07:31:16,{},fp56smv,False,t3_gb4fv2,False,True,t1_fp42uoh,/r/scandinavia/comments/gb4fv2/5_krematorier_130_lig_på_1_uge_2_krematorier/fp56smv/,1588318277,1.0,True,False,scandinavia,t5_2r2nz,0.0,[],1588311076.0,,,

Even if they reopen, the economy will never return to pre-covid era, not for years.  And there's nothing anyone can do about that.  Social Behavior in people has been permanently affected by this pandemic.

Many jobs are converting to more permanent work from home situations, that will have a huge impact on gas and traffic patterns for decades.  Not to mention consumer purchasing demands and commercial purchasing demands.  I.e. the commercial demand for toilet paper will never be what it was pre covid, and the residential demand for toilet paper will be higher post covid than pre covid, factories need to adjust.

&gt; SINGAPORE - A 42-year-old woman who spat at a KFC worker has been arrested under charges of creating a public nuisance, the police said on Saturday (April 25).

&gt; The incident happened at the KFC outlet at Nex shopping mall on Wednesday.

&gt; Investigations showed that the woman had an argument with a member of the service staff at the outlet when she was told to wait for her order, the police said.

&gt; The woman was unhappy with the wait, and she shouted and spat at the staff.

&gt; She had already left the outlet when the police arrived but officers from the Ang Mo Kio Police Division established her identity and subsequently arrested her on Friday.

&gt; Police investigations are ongoing.

&gt; ""The police are also looking at possible breaches of Covid-19 circuit breaker measures committed by the woman,"" police said.

&gt; The offence of causing public nuisance carries a fine of up to $2,000.

&gt; If the offender knew that the act would cause or would probably cause injury to others, the person could be jailed for up to three months and fined up to $2,000.

&gt; ""The police take a serious view of such egregious and irresponsible behaviour, especially in the current Covid-19 situation,"" police said.

&gt; Meanwhile, the police also said on Saturday that they are investigating a 34-year-old man for promoting enmity between different racial groups.

&gt; Police had received a report linked to offensive content against Indian migrant workers posted by a Twitter user with the handle @sharonliew86.

&gt; Bedok Police Division officers identified the Twitter user on Thursday. The man is believed to be involved in two other cases involving offensive tweets, police said.

&gt; Those found guilty of promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of race can be jailed for up to three years and fined.

&gt; Assistant Commissioner of Police Julius Lim, commander of Bedok Police Division, said: ""At a time when we need the nation to stand as one, acts that sow racial discord cannot be condoned...We will continue to take a tough stand against those who seek to stoke community tensions in multi-racial Singapore.""

A couple of things stood out:

1) The man is clearly a sociopath. Clearly. This isn't anything new. Add [this](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-claims-no-responsibility-for-spike-in-poison-control-calls-after-bleach-remarks?via=twitter_page) to the list of evidence. 

2) The administration is in full 'blame China mode' - despite every indication from a US Intelligence standpoint that he was being briefed on this as early as January if not sooner....this relates back to 1). [Briefings](https://lawandcrime.com/covid-19-pandemic/trump-was-repeatedly-warned-about-covid-19-but-trivialized-the-significance-of-intelligence-briefings/)

3) The fact that this administration is calling on OANN is a really scary move for democracy in this country. Fox News was bad enough but this is on an entirely different level. The dangers of having a journalistic medium for any administration engaging in a feedback loop cannot be understated. There is a line where journalism crosses into officially sanctioned propaganda and this administration has willingly crossed it. It is a really, really bad development. [History should have taught us this by now.](https://www.salon.com/2018/09/18/lessons-from-a-century-ago-it-is-dangerous-to-believe-your-own-propaganda_partner/)

4) Trump does not understand math. At all. We are at 56K dead. Yesterday he mused that he thought we would end up somewhere between 60K and 70K dead total. We had 754 deaths exactly one month ago from today. Even if we averaged 1,000 a day across the US, we are over 70K in 14 days. If we averaged 500 deaths a day we are over 70K in 28 days. This isn't going to go away in 14 days or 28. This isn't complicated stuff. [Source.](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/)

5) Trump claimed China payed for the tariffs on their imported goods. This is false, false, false. We did - the American consumer. No matter how many times he repeats this lie, the press should not allow him to get away with it. Not. Even. Once. [Facts.](https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/what-tariff-and-who-pays-it)

6) The dog and pony show that opened up the presser was really 'test' orientated. At least it seems he came around to the understanding that in order to open up the economy back in any meaningful way, we need to understand what we are fighting.  [It only took him about a month to realize this, though.](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/492129-trump-downplays-need-for-widespread-testing-before-reopening-economy)

That's like a madman shooting someone in the face and then claiming their real problem is that the person who shot them in the face isn't paying for their hospital bills. 

Hysterical state governments emulating authoritarian CCP style lockdowns is what is causing this recession. Full stop. 

&gt; Don’t you think the pandemic coming back worse than before would have a worse economic effect in the long run then a couple more weeks of lockdown?

The WHO just praised Sweden for their sensible and far less restrictive and far less economically damaging response to this virus. All the lockdown can possibly do is slow the spread of this disease. That just means deferring deaths for a later date. A ""second wave"" is inevitable and literally everyone knew that a month ago. 

Even worse, a big part of the reason our hospitals were overwhelmed was cuomo's idiotic feel good policy of forcing nursing homes to allow people with coronavirus to stay there. We would have seen ~25% fewer hospitalizations and deaths if we quarantined nursing homes and kept covid patients fucking out of them. 

Sweden's hospitals are NOT overwhelmed and Detroit hospitals are half full because we now know this virus is orders of magnitude less deadly than the ""experts"" who destroyed our economy told us it would be. 

The antibody tests show the infection rate in sweden to be somewhere around 26% and ours is somewhere around 21%. The only problem is that ours WILL match theirs in a month or two, but we will have decimated out country and forced tens of millions into crushing poverty as a direct result of our hysterical response.

I have seen some posts that specifically state ""we had our small gathering of 10 people which is the max our town/city/county/state will allow."" Others say they maxed out at 6 people. Of course now I can't find one of these posts to reference or ask these people directly, but how do you find out your local/county/state limit?

Im in northern CA, Sonoma County, and I have looked high and low online and even tried calling around to some county offices, but couldn't reach anyone. I can't find any specific wording for group limits.

Current date is 07/18/20

FH and I are in the middle of lining up vendors for a possible new date in Sep, but most likely will be rescheduling for 7/2021.

If, by some miracle, we get some good news by mid-May and can proceed with 7/18, we will try. Including us and our 1 photographer, we will have 32 people maximum on the premises at our venue. Catering staff are dropping off only.

Any help on finding specific information is appreciated.

Quest appears to use both the Abbott and the EUROIMMUN tests. The first tests only for IgG which would work after infection is ending or cleared. The second may be more broad.  Neither are yet among the four approved tests. I would guess that they are probably pretty good though as those organizations are reliable and competent.

&gt;Hell pregnancy tests give false positives/negatives all the time and we’ve had them for years. 

The difference being though, is that pregnancy tests are much more accurate, nothing needs to be extracted, analysed or amplified to detect genetic material. You simply piss on a stick and get your result, they can be done at home and even if they give you what you assume is a false negative or positive you can get a completely accurate result and confirmation from visiting the doctor, which you cannot with the PCR or antibody test.

Title: **Non-Renewal Fee disguised as a Termination Fee**

Original Post: 

&gt; Hello,
&gt; 
&gt; We have recently been forced to close our office due to the effects of the current covid-19 situation. Albeit last- minute, we provided 2 months notice in advance, which we believed was sufficient.
&gt; 
&gt; The service office are now demanding a Termination Fee, regardless of the notice provided. From my reading of the contract, the termination fee seems to be completely unavoidable, and that this cost would always be due regardless of any scenario.
&gt; 
&gt; “Termination of the Agreement can only be done with 2 months’ notice to end Service Agreement, prior to the lease term end date listed in section 6, at which point the term pertaining to the office suite number and rental, outlined in section 5 and 6 terminates. Therefore the client is obligated to pay termination fees outlined in terms and conditions for make good and transitional VO, per the contract.”
&gt; 
&gt; This appears to be a catch-22 on non renewal of contracts, which I feel is unlawful, and naughty especially given the current climate. Can anyone give any advice here. Thank you

To be honest I'm not super financially stable right now due to the COVID-19 situation, the foam was only around $30 for 18 panels.

Using her medicine (stuff she uses for medicinal purposes) to get some kind of high is completely unnecessary, especially when she only has a small bottle. YTA.

Not only that, but you somehow think that non-medically approve CBD that is 1/20th the cost of her CBD would have the same effects and potency and call her picky for only trusting medical grab and lab approved products. YTA

If you are trying to make a change i find making a promise with someone or a bet is a good way to force yourself into it, or just have someone who can encourage you.  Some other methods i use or my friends use is a whiteboard or post it notes.  I use a whiteboard in my room to write down goals and workouts to keep me on track, and some of my friends have post it notes on their mirror to help them keep track and remind themselves.

 Most people at the start will do things like 3×8-12 depending on the exercise and their fitness level.  And at the start its a pretty good way to build a bit of strength, size and endurance in your muscles if they are not used to being trained.  And yes it is possible to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time, and it is one of the reasons that just looking at a scale is not necessarily an accurate way to gauge fat loss.  A better way is a body fat % test or looking at the changing measurements of your body like inches off your waist.  These are still not perfect methods but in my opinion they are preferable to a scale.

Some basic things to remember are to always warmup and cooldown to prevent injury, specifically warming up and cooling down the muscle groups you intend to use.  A basic and quick general fitness plan could look something like this:

WARM UP:
5 min jog
30 sec wall pushups
30 sec squats
30 seconds of high knees 
30 seconds of butt kicks

CARDIO:
30 min jog/swim/15 min of skipping/or sprints

Resistance:
Hip hinge 12 or 30 sec
Squat 12 or 30 sec
Pushup 12 or 30 sec
Calf raise 12 or 30 sec
Sittup 12 or 30 sec
Rest 1min
Repeat circuit 3 times

Cool Down
Can repeat warmup here but at a lighter pace

And then stretch afterwards hold the stretches for about 30 seconds and rest for about that long between sets.  Do at least 2 sets.

Obviously this is not perfect as it is just an example i made off the top of my head, but having someone else build an outline for you can help with motivation.  In the end the best workout is the one that you will do.

If you want to lose fat the main thing is going to be eating in a defecit, so its good to know what your body burns at rest.  For some people starting it helps to remember that you don't have to be perfect, if you planned to be 500 cal defecit and you were only 250 below or even didn't reach one day, as long as you keep the trend going down results will come.  Also neat little tip is that muscle burns fat really well so the more muscle you put on the more efficient your body will become at burning fat.

Note*:  i am not a trained professional or master at personal training.  My only qualification is an associates degree in Sports Science.

Also if you want to talk more personally about this kind of stuff feel free to PM me i am happy to help out :).

More than 430 million enterprises in hard-hit sectors such as retail and manufacturing risk ""serious disruption"", the UN agency added.
The findings appear in the ILO Monitor third edition: COVID-19 and the world of work, released Wednesday.
Globally, there are some 3.3 billion workers. Two billion have jobs in the informal economy, the most vulnerable workers in the labour market. The agency said 1.6 billion in the informal economy ""have suffered massive damage to their capacity to earn a living"" as a result of the economic meltdown triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to lockdowns or because they work in hard-hit sectors, these workers globally have seen a 60 per cent drop in income during the first month of the crisis, according to ILO estimates.
This translates into a more than 80 per cent decline in Africa and the Americas, 70 per cent in Europe and Central Asia, and 21.6 per cent in Asia and the Pacific, the ILO said.
ILO Director General Guy Ryder said as the pandemic and the jobs crisis evolve, the need to protect the world's most vulnerable workers becomes even more urgent.
""For millions of workers, no income means no food, no security and no future. Millions of businesses around the world are barely breathing. They have no savings or access to credit,"" he said. ""These are the real faces of the world of work. If we don't help them now, they will simply perish.""
The UN agency estimated that compared to the pre-crisis levels, there will be a 10.5 per cent deterioration in working hours during the second quarter (Q2) of the year, equivalent to 305 million full-time jobs. Previous projections had put the figure at 6.7 per cent, or 195 million full-time workers.
The situation has worsened for all major regions, again compared to pre-crisis levels. Q2 estimates suggest a 12.4 per cent loss of working hours in the Americas, and 11.8 per cent for Europe and Central Asia. All other regions are above 9.5 per cent.
The ILO added that the proportion of workers living in countries where workplace closures have been recommended, or required, has decreased from 81 per cent to 68 per cent over the past two weeks.
While this is largely due to changes in China, measures have been stepped up elsewhere. At the same time, 436 million enterprises operating in wholesale and retail, manufacturing, accommodation, and other economic sectors that have been hardest hit, face ""high risks of seriousruption"".
The ILO called for ""urgent, targeted and flexible measures"" to support both workers and business, particularly smaller enterprises and those in the informal economy.
""Measures for economic reactivation should follow a job-rich approach, backed by stronger employment policies and institutions, better-resourced and comprehensive social protection systems. International coordination on stimulus packages and debt relief measures will also be critical to making recovery effective and sustainable. International labour standards, which already enjoy tripartite consensus, can provide a framework,"" it said.
The ILO also stressed that international coordination on stimulus packages and debt relief measures will be critical to making recovery effective and sustainable.

The long term consequences are unknown and thats why i prefer the wait and see approach. If we can identify a certain cellular pathway which is crucial for the infection, we can block this pathway specifically and therefore treat the disease. 

As you stated, it is truly problematic that there is no global approach and every country is fighting this with their own strategies. I partly blame the USA, if they would've had a president with even the average intelligence about infectous diseases they could have guided the world towards a common and early response.",,2020-04-28 10:10:56,{},fotwiwg,False,t3_g8yy5n,False,True,t1_fotuf9x,/r/Coronavirus/comments/g8yy5n/sweden_to_shut_bars_and_restaurants_that_ignore/fotwiwg/,1588068657,1.0,True,False,Coronavirus,t5_2x4yx,0.0,[],1588061456.0,,,
