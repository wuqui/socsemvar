I just heard from my mausi that one of my cousins has tested positive for Covid-19.

He had high fever from 9th July. For few days he took paracetamol etc but situation deteriorated and he almost fainted.

He then went for testing. Since he was feeling so weak, fever, constant coughing it was a very gruesome experience  to stand in line with tens of people to get tested.

Finally he tested positive and got admitted on night of 11th July.

Seeing his past history Doctors have told that if survives till 18th July somehow he will survive otherwise he's in God's hands.

From what I know some attendant leaves tablets for 10 days at one go for the patient.

Food is also delivered at the doorstep of the ward.

Since he was feeling so weak he had trouble getting up to get his food to his bed and eat it (He is on Oxygen support now fyi courtesy some local contacts of my mausi since he was deteriorating fast and doctors were not even ready to come as everyone fears for their own lives and don't want to come see him or others)

So his mausi gave him an ultimatum that if he wants to survive he has to walk those steps on his own. (He initially asked other patients in the ward to help him but they refused saying everyone's on their own and they are working to save themselves)

Waiting to see how the situation develops in the coming 1 week.

**EDIT: - He also has a wife and kids. So far no one has come to them for testing via contact tracing. In the meantime my mausi has asked his family to start eating the medicines they have given my cousin in the hospital at home on their own as a precaution so that situation doesn't turn drastic hopefully later on**",,2020-07-15 15:29:22,{},fy5i01k,True,t3_hb57dg,False,True,t3_hb57dg,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/hb57dg/india_covid19_pandemic_megathread_9/fy5i01k/,1594838717.0,2,True,False,IndiaSpeaks,t5_3d4x4,,0.0,[],1594819762.0,,,1594828483.0

I explained it had drained my battery. 

I also just learned that during Covid, they turned off all lock outs. I had no idea. Had this happened any other time, I possibly would have gotten a violation, though I'm not sure how that works since I've never had one. (8 months in on my 1 year sentence.) 

My advice is to make sure you don't go more than a couple days without driving. Driving it will allow the alternator to recharge the battery. And if you don't have jumper cables, buy some to keep in your car.

If you're really worried about it, you could always call lifesafer and explain what happened.

[],,Rayd8630,,,[],,,,text,t2_9wvdr,False,False,[],"We did, however the Liberals under Trudeau secured only a minority. Since then, a lot has happened:

* At the start of the COVID outbreak our government was slow to react. They did not wish to close borders for various reasons. They had also gave away most of our emergency PPE stockpile for disasters to China (which I will assume was in the hopes that if China could prevent it from becoming a pandemic by fighting it and securing it within its borders). Once Justins wife contracted COVID however, and he had spoken at a mining conference that may have left himself compromised, his tone changed and Canada went into a soft-lockdown of sorts.
* The first bill the Liberals tried to push was one that would give them limitless spending and taxation power. This enraged most Canadians and the bill was quickly crushed.
* After a tragic mass shooting in Nova Scotia, his government used an OIC (Order In Council) to ban quite a few firearms within Canada. The OIC was faulty and full of holes (they said they wouldnt go after hunting weapons and did, they made it so most Indigenous Canadians were exempt from this OIC). Many saw this as an attack on legal gun owners, while doing nothing about illegally procured weapons that get smuggled across the border. This has led people to believe this is a mass power grab/tactic to win his UN seat/experiment in property seizure in Canada.
* They suspended parliament and have basically spent recklessly with millions if not billions of dollars being unaccounted for, while Canada had a roughly 13% unemployment rate.
* The latest issue is Trudeau had planned to give $900 million dollars to a charity to fund volunteers and administration costs. Though his wife, and his mother were set to receive hundreds of thousands of dollars as part of the plan. Not to mention our current finance minister voted on it despite having a conflict of interest as his two daughters work for this charity.

Railway Minister Piyush Goyal in  a tweet  hailed the Indian Railways for gearing up to export the dry chillies to Bangladesh.
The Special Parcel Express (SPE) from Guntur station of the South Central railway is carrying 384 tonnes of parcel over the distance of 1372 kilometre from Reddipalem in Guntur to Benapole in Bangladesh.

Guntur is the centre for export of Chilli and other spices from India. It is among the largest chilli producing districts in India.
The transportation cost by railways works out to be cheaper compared to the road transport.
The permission for running the parcel cargo into Bangladesh was obtained quickly with the help of the High Commission of India in Bangladesh. 
Earlier the High Commission of India had requested the Ministry of Railways, Bangladesh to facilitate parcel train service between India and Bangladesh during the video conference meeting arranged by the High Commission of India on 4th May.
The Railway Adviser at the High Commission of India in Bangladesh Anita Barik said that this new service other than the freight services will boost bilateral trade by rail between India and Bangladesh.
Bangladesh has a high demand for spices like turmeric, ginger, onion and cumin seeds from India. The export of spices from India to Bangladesh had been affected as the transport services between the two countries got disrupted due to COVID-19 related restrictions since March.",,2020-07-13 05:21:27,{},fxwhqr9,True,t3_hq9ge2,False,True,t3_hq9ge2,/r/DDnews/comments/hq9ge2/first_parcel_cargo_with_chilli_for_bangladesh/fxwhqr9/,1594622943.0,1,True,False,DDnews,t5_2fp314,,0.0,[],1594610487.0,,,

This is copied from the CDC page on [Schools](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/schools-childcare/schools.html))

&gt; The risk of COVID-19 spread increases in school settings as follows:

&gt; Lowest Risk: Students and teachers engage in virtual-only classes, activities, and events.

&gt; More Risk: Small, in-person classes, activities, and events. Groups of students stay together and with the same teacher throughout/across school days and groups do not mix. Students remain at least 6 feet apart and do not share objects (e.g., hybrid virtual and in-person class structures, or staggered/rotated scheduling to accommodate smaller class sizes).

&gt; Highest Risk: Full sized, in-person classes, activities, and events. Students are not spaced apart, share classroom materials or supplies, and mix between classes and activities.__

It looks like they agree going back is the highest risk. Obviously we’ll be taking precautions so we’re probably in the “More Risk” category. 

Other CDC recommendations are:

1. Stay 6 ft. apart. (The district where I works has acknowledged this is next to impossible, so they’re saying 3 ft. Add another point to the risk column.)

2. Have proper ventilation and open doors/windows. (This is not possible in many classrooms which would be another factor that increases risk.)

3. Space students on buses. (Again, not possible if most students come back for in person. They are almost always seated 2 to a seat, so that another high risk opportunity.)

4. Cohort students. (Certain student populations  who receive additional supports will have to mix. We don’t have the time or staff to provide legally required service minutes without mixing.)
This study from [Harvard and Boston Children’s Hospital ](https://hms.harvard.edu/news/covid-19-children) has said that children seem to less susceptible, which is great! But it also states that testing of children has been limited. 

Some other studies are saying that it spreads more among older students, which would put our middle school and high schoolers at risk, especially since they take multiple classes a day and typically mix. I’m honestly not sure if/how they are keeping the same students together.  

Speaking for my district only, I believe they are  trying to do the best they can to create a safe environment for a return. But the risk is still very real and depends on a lot of factors.

On March 2nd the first stay-at-home order goes into effect, requiring non-essential businesses to close. It relies on a federal list that defined what industries were essential; gun stores were not on that list. 

On April 9th Whitmer reissues her order. Since her first one, however, the federal government added the firearms industry, including retailers, to its list of essential businesses. But Whitmer specifically declines to adopt that updated list and continues to rely on the initial list that they stay closed. 

She's a lib, she's no friend to firearms in the first place. Libs in general are looking for any way to impede people from owning/carrying guns. To them, covid is just as good as a reason as any.

**Trump Classifies Gun Stores, Shooting Ranges And Weapon Manufacturers As “Essential Services”**

Our rights don't stop just because of covid, thankfully Trump stepped in.  

And obviously you know what happen afterward. There are no guns left after all the protests and covid fears, everyone bought them all. Clearly, people wanted their guns. 

But back to the issues here with getting in a CPL in Michigan. The same thing happen where I'm at. The county clerk wasn't doing livescan anymore, thus shutting down all CPL's. They recently opened back up, but I have no doubt it was by force, or them dragging their feet because it isn't high on the list. I've had my CPL long before any of this happened. But I don't like what Whitmer did.

 Throwaway account for what I think might be obvious reasons.

Two friends of mine are dating. One tested positive for COVID-19 and told me. I asked if I could let our circle of friends know, to which the answer I received was I could “if \[I\] want to”. \[For the record, in case it matters, we are all adults; myself, the friend who tested positive, the partner, and our circle of friends.\] So, I let our circle of friends know and word got back to the partner of said friend. Said partner is now pissed at me because (1) according to the partner, the friend who tested positive “did not want \[me\] to tell \[our friends\]” \[note: due to the circumstances, I have not yet confirmed this statement with the friend who tested positive\] and (2) said partner did not find out from the friend who tested positive directly but from others I had told. When I explained to the partner the fact the friend who tested positive said I could, I was told I need “to learn how to translate” the friend who tested positive.

So, AITA for taking the friend who tested positive at their word?

""and neither your conclusions nor Fauci's conclusions can be considered irrefutable facts""

no one has ever claimed to have ""irrefutable facts"" in science. Fauci is the foremost immunologist and leading expert on infectious disease (probably in the world) the same way anyone else is seen as a leading expert. Through experience and achievement. No one has ever said Fauci has ""all the answers"".he doesnt. no one does. But what he does have is access to the data, experience/expertise to interpret that data to have the BEST answers possible at this time. If you actually took the time to listen to what hes said and not be told what he said you would see he has been extremely consistent with his messaging and predictions.  

I honestly feel so bad for the guy.Hes got the toughest job in the world right trying to save as many lives as possible while being muzzled from speaking to the press to get information and guidance out to the public.then is forced to continue shouting from the rooftops how to deal with this and be ignored by those above him.

We awe obwigatowy Facebook  fwiends though, mostwy due to my aunt and mothew asking us both to add  each othew.

Skip ahead to pwesent  day: A few days ago I got a caww fwom a bank I have a cwedit cawd  thwough, inquiwing about my bawance not being paid, as I have awways  paid my outstanding biwws on time. I towd the bank empwoyee I had not  used my cawd, so that chawge was fwaud. The cawd account was immediatewy  cwosed, and they began the pwocess of wooking fuwthew into it. Today  they cawwed me back with an update. The chawge was fow a donation to a  chawity that I knew of but have nevew contwibuted to mysewf. Stiww  confused about why my cawd was used, I posted a showt want on FB. I got a  few wepwies tewwing me this had nevew happened to them, and hoping I  got it aww wesowved soon. Then my cousin, the one who was wude at the  baby showew, commented something to the effect of “Weww, maybe someone  had a good weason fow making the donation in youw name. Maybe someone  wanted to teach you a wesson.” The comment was weiwd, so I PM’ed hew to  ask what she meant.

I went with a fwiend one day and found that I enjoyed the  chuwch she attends, so I kept going with hew. I’m not vocaw about my  newfound bewiefs. I don’t thwow it in peopwe’s faces ow demand they  bewieve the same. It’s just something that I wike fow my own wife. It  makes me feew bettew and mowe wewaxed. Appawentwy my cousin has a  pwobwem with me deciding to attend and join a chuwch of any kind. And  because of that she decided it was a good idea to sneak awound and take  photos of my cwedit cawd.

&gt;Though health officials have warned Americans to prepare for the spread of the novel coronavirus in the U.S., people **shouldn’t wear face masks** to prevent the spread of the infectious illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. surgeon general.

\~\~\~
