From the article (which unlike the posting title, is on target) and based on CDC and ACOG guidelines:

‚ÄúIf you have the symptoms of COVID-19, you should self-isolate for 7 days following these guidelines. If you are self-isolating, you should not access the neonatal unit until a negative test has been confirmed or you have stopped showing any symptoms. You can ask for a COVID-19 test online here, but please be aware that there is currently a high demand for tests and it is not guaranteed you will get one. ‚Äú

‚ÄúIf you have had a positive test for COVID-19, you will not be able to access your baby on the neonatal unit until at least 7 days after the onset of the illness and only once you have stopped showing any symptoms.

Passageiros tamb√©m relataram que os coletivos estavam mais cheios, quatro dias ap√≥s a[ libera√ß√£o para que shoppings e com√©rcios de rua voltassem a funcionar na cidade.](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/sao-paulo/2020/06/centenas-de-consumidores-fazem-fila-a-espera-da-abertura-de-shopping-em-sp.shtml)

 A cuidadora de idosos L√∫cia Silva, 45 anos, voltou a usar √¥nibus h√° cerca de duas semanas, quando retomou o trabalho com a fam√≠lia que a emprega. Como notou ps √¥nibus mais cheios na avenida Dona Belmira Marin, ela resolveu embarcar em uma linha mais vazia. ‚ÄúO ideal seria pegar a 675G-10 [Pq. Residencial Cocaia-Metr√¥ Jabaquara], mas esta √© muito lotada e me sinto insegura de viajar nela‚Äù, disse.

  No mesmo ponto de √¥nibus, o promotor de vendas Carlos Machado, 42, n√£o conseguiu embarcar no primeiro √¥nibus da linha 6115-10 (Terminal Graja√∫-Cantinho do C√©u), pois o ve√≠culo estava muito cheio e o motorista n√£o parou. ‚ÄúSempre uso esta linha, que enche de gente. J√° vi o motorista negando viagens mais adiante, quando [o ve√≠culo] fica mais cheio. Mas neste ponto aqui, √© a primeira vez que acontece.‚Äù Machado ainda disse que chegaria atrasado ao trabalho.

 Em dez minutos, 23 √¥nibus passaram pelo ponto onde estavam a cuidadora e o promotor de vendas. Destes, 13 estavam bem cheios e com pessoas viajando em p√©.

 ### Falta fiscaliza√ß√£o nas ruas, afirma motorista

 Um motorista de √¥nibus afirmou, em condi√ß√£o de anonimato, que os coletivos circulam cheios de passageiros pois n√£o h√° fiscaliza√ß√£o nas ruas e corredores. Segundo ele, somente nos terminais h√° fiscais.

 A falha na fiscaliza√ß√£o tambem √© apontada pelos passageiros. A psic√≥loga Camila Santos, 34 anos, conta que o √¥nibus que utiliza sai do Terminal Graja√∫ (zona sul de SP) com quase todos os assentos ocupados e sem passageiros em p√©. ‚ÄúMas √© s√≥ ir para a rua que as pessoas come√ßam a embarcar e [o ve√≠culo] come√ßa a encher de gente, inclusive em p√©.‚Äù

 Quando retorna do trabalho, por volta das 16h, Camila diz que os coletivos chegam ao terminal abarrotados de pessoas.

 ### De volta √† rotina

 Tanto passageiros quanto motoristas de √¥nibus entrevistados pelo **Agora **foram un√¢nimes em dizer que a lota√ß√£o dos √¥nibus est√° bem pr√≥xima do que era antes da pandemia.

 Por volta das 7h30, a atendente de call center Liliane Marques Duarte, 24 anos, aguardava √¥nibus na parada Rio Bonito, em Cidade Dutra (zona sul de SP), para seguir a Santo Amaro, onde trabalha. Ela conta que desde o fim da semana passada, j√° se sente como ""antes da quarentena"", decretada pelo governo estadual em 24 de mar√ßo. ‚ÄúO n√∫mero de passageiros voltou √† rotina do que era antes [da pandemia]. A √∫nica diferen√ßa √© que o povo agora est√° usando m√°scaras.‚Äù

 Liliane usa a linha 695H-10 (Jd. Herplin-Terminal Santo Amaro) que, segundo ela, est√° sempre lotada. ""Nunca consigo viajar sentada"", diz.  
   
 Enquanto a atendente falava com a reportagem, um √¥nibus da linha 5370-10 (Terminal Varginha-Largo S√£o Francisco) parou no ponto e muitos passageiros desembarcaram. Mesmo assim, o coletivo ainda ficou lotado. Uma mulher se aproximou do ve√≠culo e bateu com a m√£o na porta de embarque, que estava fechada. O motorista abriu e ela teve de pedir licen√ßa aos demais passageiros para conseguir entrar, em raz√£o da grande quantidade de pessoas

 ### Resposta

 A Prefeitura de S√£o Paulo, gest√£o Bruno Covas (PSDB), afirmou ter orientado as empresas de √¥nibus a realizar viagens, sem exceder a capacidade m√°xima de passageiros sentados, em decorr√™ncia do uso das linhas por trabalhadores de servi√ßos que voltaram a funcionar na cidade. ""O objetivo √© reduzir a dissemina√ß√£o do v√≠rus"", diz trecho de nota.  
   
 A SPTrans (empresa que gerencia o transporte p√∫blico da capital paulista) afirmou que acionou sua equipe de fiscaliza√ß√£o para apurar o desempenho operacional das linhas citadas pela reportagem e far√° os ajustes, quando necess√°rios. A fiscaliza√ß√£o √© realizada por 673 profissionais, afirma a empresa.  
   
 Ainda segundo o governo municipal, a frota em funcionamento nesta segunda-feira (15) √© de 11.828 carros, representando 92,31% da frota operacional. Os ve√≠culos atendem 1.266 linhas para uma demanda de 1,3 milh√£o de pessoas, segundo registrado na sexta-feira (12).  
   
 Segundo a pasta, em reuni√£o realizada na √∫ltima quarta-feita (10), entre a Secretaria Municipal dos Transportes e rerpresentantes das empresas de √¥nibus, foi reconhecida a ""impossibilidade de retorno de toda a frota √†s ruas"", por causa do percentual de funcion√°rios afastados por integrar o grupo de risco de cont√°gio da Covid-19.",,2020-06-15 20:01:08,{},fuxpxk7,True,t3_h9no15,False,True,t3_h9no15,/r/brasilnoticias/comments/h9no15/ap√≥s_ultimato_de_covas_e_sa√≠da_de_secret√°rio/fuxpxk7/,1592255593.0,1,True,False,brasilnoticias,t5_3a1qf,,0.0,[],1592244068.0,,,

The way I see it, market conditions are currently difficult for value investors like Buffett, since it's difficult to predict future FCF or earnings. At the same time it's a gold mine for speculative investors as every beaten-down sector will eventually be pumped, so you can make good money getting there first (I'm normally a long-term investor, but made good money on retail, financials and airplane manufacturers in this rally despite selling too early).

Obviously each individual is different in terms of what they need but here are some general things to start that I've found helpful as someone in your bf's shoes:

- check in with him every day by text. Something simple like ""I love you, I'm thinking about you, and I'm here if you want to talk or vent at all."" He may want to curl up in a ball and ignore the world, and that's perfectly okay, but just knowing that you are there if he needs him will mean the world. Sending him a message to let him know you're thinking about him and care about him, along with a no-pressure offer to talk any time he needs to, will be an emotional security blanket that he can use when he wants.

- If finances allow, help with food by sending easy meals/delivery/gift cards/etc. Being a caretaker and/or emotional caretaker of a dying loved one is almost like being forced to function while constantly in a deep depression: basically, self-care becomes the last thing on your mind. Making meals easier is a huge way to help and ensure he keeps his strength up. If you don't have the resources to do this (it's a lot harder from a different city, as in your situation), I'd stronlgy recommend reaching out to his friends/coworkers/people who care about him in his area and ask them to just leave some easy meals on his doorstep or pitch in for a grubhub gift card or something. If he has a dog people can volunteer to help walk the dog. Any chores, tasks, or household stuff that would usualyl be his responsibility (again, this is hard with COVID but do what you can) should be taken off his plate as much as possible.

- Be patient with him (I'm sure you are, but it bears repeating) as he goes through grief. Personally I know I've been angry and irritable and that I've been snippy with people: at 31 (and after 3+ years in therapy) I've gotten to the point where I can communicate this to people and let them know my general emotional state. At 21, your boyfriend may not fully recognize where he is and how he's feeling (and that's okay). This doesn't excuse him being a huge asshole or anything, but keep in mind that he's going to be walking around with a huge amount of fear, grief, and anger and that these are powerful emotions that may come out at seemingly random times, and that's normal.

- Above all, just keep the lines of communication open and remind him that you love him and that you are going to be there for him no matter what. For me, just knowing that I can cry on my wife's shoulder or call and vent to my best friend whenever I need to is a huge relief.

- Lastly, if it's safe and financially feasible, I would try to make a plan to travel to be there for the funeral. It will be a very difficult time for him and having you there would mean a lot.

This stranger is wishing you, your boyfriend, and his family all the best.",,2020-06-15 16:29:52,{},fuwz3fa,False,t3_h997wo,False,True,t3_h997wo,/r/relationships/comments/h997wo/my19f_boyfriends_21m_mom_is_dying_i_want_to_help/fuwz3fa/,1592239595.0,1,True,False,relationships,t5_2qjvn,,0.0,[],1592231392.0,,,
[],,CoolNebraskaGal,,,[],,,,text,t2_kvuicsv,False,False,[],"The NYT The Daily podcast had an episode about this on May 20th, ""Why is the Pandemic Killing So Many Black Americans"". This [NPR article also explains more on this topic.](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/30/865413079/what-do-coronavirus-racial-disparities-look-like-state-by-state)

Covid does not discriminate on race, but i'm not sure the data is implying that black people are more likely to contract Covid, as much as they are much more likely to have poorer outcomes.

* Nationally, African-American deaths from COVID-19 are nearly two times greater than would be expected based on their share of the population. In four states, the rate is three or more times greater.¬†
* In 42 states plus Washington D.C., Hispanics/Latinos make up a greater share of confirmed cases than their share of the population. In eight states, it's more than four times greater.¬†
* White deaths from COVID-19 are lower than their share of the population in 37 states and the District of Columbia.¬†¬†

This is all fairly unsurprising considering that health outcomes from black Americans are not great across the board, even when you account for other factors. This is true for [infant and maternal mortality rates,](https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/reports/2019/05/02/469186/eliminating-racial-disparities-maternal-infant-mortality/) or [high blood pressure, diabetes and stroke,](https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/aahealth/index.html) and now Covid-19.

As far as this guy and his pledge to get all of his black community members healthcare, it seems like it's a response to systemic racism. So ""to combat systemic racism, we're going to focus on education, healthcare, and better police training. I'm going to ensure all black Kentuckians are covered"" and not just a random pledge. But I am not particularly interested in that discussion, I just wanted to illustrate that it's not so much ""Black Americans are at greater risk to catch Covid"" as much as it is that they are affected disproportionately and have worse outcomes.",,2020-06-10 19:26:29,{},ftm6p7v,False,t3_h0ez9l,False,True,t1_ftlvtih,/r/moderatepolitics/comments/h0ez9l/beshear_says_state_will_put_resources_into_making/ftm6p7v/,1591830449.0,1,True,False,moderatepolitics,t5_2s6h3,,0.0,[],1591809989.0,1591817411.0,,

A lot of people are sharing a graph titled ""murder of black and whites in the US, 2013"" to show that there is only a small number of black Americans killed by white Americans, with the assumption that this extends to police shootings as well. This is misleading because the chart only counts deaths where the perpetrator was charged with 1st or 2nd degree murder after killing a black American. Police forces are almost never charged with homicide after killing a black American.

I don't remember if I ever failed the song, but I remember struggling with ""Shout at the Devil"" in GH2 on easy difficulty when I first played the game. So it's not unusual for people to find that sort of stuff tricky. It ended up taking me about 6 months of frequent playing before I was able to beat GH2 and its final boss song Freebird by Lynyrd Skynyrd on expert guitar, and then it wasn't until like mid-2008 until I was able to pass TtFaF by DragonForce on expert guitar in GH3 despite being able to play on expert at the time of GH3's release which was late 2007 iirc.

Like, I actually found while I did hit some walls in terms of getting better, that if I kept to the game enough that I could just keep increasing my skills further and further. Like I first gold started Caprici di Diablo some time in 2012 or 2013 iirc which I hadn't been able to do prior despite being able to pass all the DragonForce songs which had been released for GH and RB up to that point, except maybe OGaP in RB. But yeah, it's definitely a game where you can just keep getting better and better if you put the practice in, though honestly I've felt like that time may be better spent learning an instrument + some theory so I can be actually creative and express my own musical ideas, which is part of why I'm getting interested in Rocksmith again. Though I would ideally be able to take guitar lessons to make sure I'm not using bad technique, so that may have to wait until Covid isn't an issue, but doing those things and reading up what I can on music theory and possibly getting more formal education in it eventually would really interest me, so I'm thinking that may take these games' places for me, except for the vocals/karaoke part which the games like RB4 are still fun for.",,2020-06-10 22:19:53,{},ftmsi21,False,t3_h0kymn,False,True,t1_ftmqxls,/r/CasualConversation/comments/h0kymn/rhythm_games_are_probably_one_of_the_best_types/ftmsi21/,1591841640.0,2,True,False,CasualConversation,t5_323oy,,0.0,[],1591820393.0,,,

The curtain raiser¬†would mark out a 10-day official countdown to IDY 2020. Union Ministers of State for AYUSH Shripad Naik, Minister of State (PMO) Dr. Jitendra Singh and¬†President,¬†Indian Council for Cultural Relation¬†Dr.¬†Vinay Sahasrabuddhe,¬†will address the nation through the electronic medium. Secretary, AYUSH Vaidya Rajesh Kotecha will grace the occasion.
In the light of the prevailing health emergency in the country due to Covid 19, this year the IDY is set to go digital internationally. In view of the highly infectious nature of the Corona virus the ministry is encouraging people to practise Yoga at their homes. The Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has also announced a video blogging contest ‚ÄúMy life, My Yoga‚Äù for the general public.
In the 10 days after the curtain raiser (i.e., from 11th June 2020 to 20th June, 2020), there will be training sessions on Common Yoga Protocol on DD Bharti/DD Sports from 08:00 AM to 08:30 AM. These will be conducted by the country‚Äôs premier Yoga teaching institution, the Morarji Desai National Institute of Yoga, New Delhi.
Yoga Gurus Swami Ramdevji, Sri Sri Ravishankarji, Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudevji, Dr. H. R. Nagendraji, Shri Kamlesh Patel ji (Daji), Sister Shivani and Swami Bharat Bhushanji will explain importance of Yoga in our lives and how we can utilise yoga to boost immunity and improve mental health and wellbeing.
Dignitaries from the Ministry will also address the people highlighting key steps taken by the Ministry to enable people to do Yoga at home during the present difficult times of the Covid 19 Pandemic. Director AIIMS, Director AIIA and Director MDNIY will join the panel of experts.
This year the IDY comes at a time when the world is in the grip of the contagious COVID-19. It is significant that the health enhancing and stress busting impacts of Yoga practice is especially relevant to the people in this situation. Therefore, for IDY -2020, it is advantageous for people to participate and learn Yoga from their respective homes‚Äî in conformity to social distancing norms. The Ministry of AYUSH¬† and numerous other¬† stake holding institutions are providing various digital resources on their portals and social media handles including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and YouTube, which the public can make use to prepare for the event.

The Mt. Sinai microbiology lab is doing William Osler's Covid testing. Mt.Sinai is the largest through-put covid lab in Ontario (and likely the country) at 7-8k tests a day. Similarly to the situation in my lab, Mt.Sinai does not have the demographic information available to them from William Osler(or any other outside site) that Public Health requires for data collection and tracing. Originally, the outside site would provide the patient info to the MLT at Mt.Sinai to be sent along to Public health. The problem starts when the lab at Mt.Sinai is told that William Osler will be sending the info to Public Health themselves. This makes sense as it saves a lot of trouble of sending the info to Sinai only to have them send it to Public Health. However, it seems the lab at William Osler wasn't made aware of this as they did not start doing it themselves. Both sites assumed the other was doing it and Public health is likely too swamped to notice until later. 

No doubt it's a major and unfortunate mistake. The patients were notified as per usual through the hospitals at least but obviously no tracing or cataloging was done by Public health until it was discovered. I really do not believe there is any conspiracy here. I say that as someone who loathes Ford and his politics.",,2020-06-07 18:07:55,{},ftaf07v,False,t3_gyd5ds,False,True,t1_fta4fm9,/r/ontario/comments/gyd5ds/ontario_reports_415_new_cases_19_new_deaths/ftaf07v/,1591556733.0,1,True,False,ontario,t5_2qsf3,,0.0,[],1591546075.0,,,
