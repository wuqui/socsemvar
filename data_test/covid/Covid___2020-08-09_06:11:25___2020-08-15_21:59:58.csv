I work in a nursing home as a CNA. Back then, in the past few months, we never had a Covid-19 outbreak. However, a few staff had it and some of the residents apparently had it. All of them were transported to the new admissions hall (one person rooms) for quarantine. I had to work this hall Saturday. 

First of all, I never had any training. First time and I had no idea there was a routine you needed to follow. Had to wear a full body gown, two sets of gloves, a mask, and a face shield. As I am working this hall, there are so many things going wrong as I'm trying to my round. 


First of all, we have to do vitals every shift and all of them (blood pressure, pulse, etc) well we could not get a reading from one of the residents because her hands were cold. So I had to spend 30 minutes warming her hands up to get a reading. This time could've spent doing a round but I couldn't because the reading was much more important. 


As I was doing my last round, and I'm already not feeling good because I'm so behind, I was getting a resident into bed. I was trying to get her a new brief but she was in pain and she did not want her brief on until she had her zinc cream on her. So I called the front desk (because you can't go back and forth because of contamination) to see if we could get some. Apparently, we were all out of it. We had no more. I told her and she said in tears ""Can you at least find some in storage? Why would I be here if I can't get any medication or help?"" There was nothing I could really do. I just told her our situation and I was on the verge of tears because I couldn't help at all.


After all this, I was charting and the main nurse of that hall was on the phone with a supervisor claiming that he had no control. He was saying stuff like ""I have no control on this hall. People are not getting there medications, The CNAs are not doing their jobs (looking at me while saying this), we have no supplies at his place"" He was just going off on the main doctor. At that point, I just could not handle it. After I finished my charting, I had to have a CNA help me outside (they offered but I gladly took it) I was on the verge of a panic attack. The CNAs after me were very nice and I am very happy grateful to have them. I asked if they needed a report and they said ""It's fine. You take care now. Have a great night"". I felt relived afterwards. 


Probably one of the worst nights I ever had.",,2020-08-15 04:43:27,{},g1iyjaq,False,t3_i9ngos,False,True,t3_i9ngos,/r/AskReddit/comments/i9ngos/men_what_made_you_cry/g1iyjaq/,1597472063.0,1,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,,0.0,[],1597459407.0,,,

What do you mean don't open anything? We close dialysis, hospitals, fire stations, grocery stores? You can't close everything. There are life sustaining businesses.

I'm honestly curious as to what people expect the future to be if Coronavirus doesn't go away? Do we no longer educate our children? Do single people remain single for the rest of their lives because they're no longer allowed to interact with others? We have to hope for a cure to Coronavirus while preparing for there to not be one. Life must go on at some point.


&gt;The problem here is the people are selfish and irresponsible. People like you. 

You don't know me, I don't know you. But I like that the anonymity of the internet has empowered you to make wild claims about my life and what I've done and continue to do every day. I bought and wore masks to protect those I interact with back in late March when they were telling us that these things don't work and only hospitals should have them. My vacation was cancelled and I used my days off to stay at home rather than relieve the stress of a difficult job through leisure. I've remained covid negative despite numerous confirmed and potential exposures. I've stayed away from all but my cohabitating family to keep them safe from March until last week.

&gt;Anyway keep your kids the hell away from mine. 

I don't have kids and wouldn't dream of bringing new life into a country like this where people make personal attacks on random strangers like:

&gt;Seriously, are you an adult? Are you going to whine to teacher the rules aren’t fair? This is life. You fuck up, your kid dies. Your fault. 

Also the covid death rate for children is smaller than the danger of riding in a car. I suppose your child just stays in a padded room all day to avoid all risk?

With complete pride. And while you maybe could try to make sense of that argument, he went out of his way to ensure that conservatives will always be “skeptical” “humble” and not afraid to “challenge the status “quo” and while those are qualities that could be revered in someone, conservatives go out of there way to challenge common sense, scientists, experts, history, science and logic, essentially. No matter what you could tell this person, it always boiled down to, well you never know, or that’s what they want you to think. 

There is no humility in the human species if you ignore all of observable and tested science in human history in the name of being Devils advocate. Especially if you turn around and believe everything anything a guy with a YouTube channel and a $500 microphone has to say? 

I think the most recent jaw dropping example I’ve seen of this kind of unhinged boldness came from one man who tweeted an article of this woman with twins who became homeless bc of covid and eviction. He straight up said, if you don’t want to be homeless, or poor, all you have to do is either 1) graduate high school 2) don’t have kids before 21 and 3) have a full time job. He said “where is the father?... exactly” he got hundreds of comments, obviously, disputing his clearly inflammatory conclusion. The whole time, he tried to act so professional and as if the data he provided supported him 100% and he was absolutely right. He LINKED an article and said “ for all you asking for the data, here is not only the data, but an article from Vox where they completely tear apart my argument...but they never dispute the data because it is true 😌”

It was so Intellectually embarrassing, from a human standpoint regardless of what anyone’s education level was. 


The article was basically titled “why conservatives use this misleading data to fuel their dumbass dogmatic beliefs and why it’s inherently flawed” 
I’ll try to find it cause it’s actually so funny. 

The article basically said, yes, OBVIOUSLY, people who graduate high school, don’t get pregnant in their teens and have stable employment don’t typically end up in poverty, but then goes on to explain in detail how and why people fall through the cracks, how the system is set up to see certain people fail, and why structural discrimination exists and this is  mans entire argument was “but even they agree the data is real it’s just their conclusions that are different 😌” as if raw data is the only thing that matters, as if correlation clearly equals causation. 

I see this everyday. Every time I see some sort of  tik tok that says. “Hey guys, I had covid, I’m still in pain after 4 months be careful”, it’s: “ THE DATA SHOWS THAT IT IS BASICALLY THE FLU” it’s the obsession with being right and not being wrong.

This is assuming you did fully tested every single TV/Monitors in your house(also tested another Switch Dock, which I suppose you do have 2 Docks and tested on both which was still not functional) to be ultra certain it simply does not work anymore when docked(display through HDMI).

Also how old is that Switch? Just to see if that console would still have the Nintendo 1 year free warranty. Let's say you bought it in January 2019 - meaning it was supposed to expire in January 2020, then Covid made you lucky since its now fully extended for you as in you would still have free warranty right now. Nintendo also covers paying for the shipping too(nintendo sends you a shipping return printed label thing), you just have to box it up securely, add the printed label and bring it the shipping courier. Now if you bought the Switch console in 2018 or earlier then nevermind because the warranty did expire... meaning you will have to pay for the repair :/

I guess you could test a soft reset(still keeping your saves intact safely), remove the Switch from the Dock and fully Power Off the Switch. Now hold together both Volume Up and Volume Down, then press the Power button and keep holding only together Volume Up/Down... passing the Nintendo logo's keep holding until you will reach a Recovery mode type thing screen(now release the volume up/down buttons) and from that screen choose ""Restore Factory Settings Without Deleting Save Data"". After that process is done, test again the docking that Switch... hopefully it works again. If it doesn't... RIP confirms Type C port is damaged for sure. If you are not confident yet and still want to troubleshoot a bit more extreme then you can do the recovery process again but instead choosing the other option which fully resets the Switch to factory new clean(everything is deleted including the saves) to test again.

-edit-

Forgot to mention, that you should you first do the troubleshoot of the basic order of connecting the things to the Dock for that *specific Switch. Remove the Switch from the Dock, Fully Power it Off. Unplug everything from the Dock, also unplug the AC Type C Power Adapter from the Power Outlet. Wait more than 30 seconds. Now plug the the AC Type C Power Adapter to the Dock and then plug it in the Power Outlet, then plug in the HDMI cable in the Dock and the TV(put your TV in the HDMI source input), then put the Switch in the Dock which should automatically Power it on.

Hi all, I've been lurking here for a little bit, and joined reddit to officially join you all and not just lurk. My wife and I have been trying since Jan 2019. The third unmedicated IUI we did resulted in a 31 week stillbirth. Since then, we've done 6 inseminations (4 in office unmedicated IUIs and two ICI at home - thanks COVID!). After the 4th negative in that second bunch, we reached out to an RE and got started working with them. When we got my day 3 results, we were sort of taken aback - &lt;0.1 AMH (lowest their assay reads), 14ish FSH, and 5 follicles. Prior to the follow up, we'd assumed that we'd move to medicated IUI, but the doctor's rec was to start IVF asap (I'll be 40 in October, and she doesn't think I'll pass the Clomid challenges, so wouldn't be covered by insurance anymore....)  We went into problem-solving mode and had my wife's  numbers checked to see if she could potentially be my donor egg, but her numbers weren't much better (0.2 AMH, 10ish FSH, 4 follicles). So we're going to try at least two rounds of IVF (trying my eggs) - the first will be an antagonist cycle with fresh transfer if we get embryos, then will try a cycle with less medicine if that doesn't work out.

I am constantly wavering between hope and being resigned that this won't happen, because it feels like it won't. I feel like I should have hope if I'm going this, but I'm also try to resign myself to the fact that my family won't be what I thought it would be. I was talking to someone recently and they talked about thinking about my intention instead of thinking about hope - my intention is to grow my family so this is the next logical step. It was a nice way to think about it instead of not beating myself up for not having hope.

Over there mask wearing is compulsory even for walking outside (not just in shops or enclosed spaces like in the UK) and compliance is nearly 100‰, except for the odd tourist. In most regions it is even compulsory in the beach, with people only allowed to remove it when sitting on their sunning spot or for swimming in the sea. Compare that with the situation here, the overcrowded beaches where you could barely see the sand and not a mask in sight. 

Spain had the strictest lockdown in the world, with children not allowed to set a foot outside their home for many weeks (adults were allowed out only for essential food or medicine shopping but had to go alone, not in couples or in groups like in the UK). 

The UK had a so called lockdown with few and unenforced personal restrictions. Took months for supermarkets and shops to set up queue systems or even hand sanitisers at the entrances. Masks in shops were only made compulsory a few days ago, ffs. Stopped using public transport in April because nobody wore any protection either. No surprise that Spain had seen off the worst of the pandemic by May, whilst in the UK the numbers have taken so long to go down. 

Now, tourism makes up to 12% of Spain's gdp, with hospitality being a very important sector too. Giving the bleak economic forecasts, there was a lot of pressure to reopen as soon as possible in order to save the summer season; the consequences are there for all to see. Young people, including young Spaniards, have been flouting the mask laws by night, undoing any effort that was being made during the day. No question about it.

Idealer i all ära, men den som vill hålla fast i idealerna kan gärna tänka på till vilken kostnad. 700 dödsfall är inte ett pris jag själv skulle vara villig för att betala för att hålla restaurangerna öppna, det är nog något jag tycker värt att klara sig med take-away en stund. 500 dödsfall är nog värt att förbättra hygienen men allmänt bruk av munskydd, etc. 

Det är särskilt enkelt att betala priset i blod om det inte är man själv som är utsatt, andras liv är mycket enklare att ofta för sina friheter än vad det är att offra sitt eget liv. 

Själv är jag faktiskt vänster just p.g.a. att jag är materialist, i filosofiska bemärkelsen på ordet, inte Madonna-bemärkelsen. Materiell analys hjälper förklara relationer i vårt samhälle på ett sätt ideell analys inte kan. 

&gt;(liberalism är inte vänster och inte från amerika, det är en stolt Europeisk uppfinning!). 

Iofs, och indelning mellan idealism och materialism är ju också en stolt europeisk uppfinning. 

De rättigheter vi talar om har ju en materiell betydelse bortom det ideella. Det är inte som jag tycker att diskussionen om rättigheter är onödig, det är heliga ko -mentaliteten jag inte har mycket till övers för. 

Som sagt, vi drar gränsen vid olika ställen. Det är bra, och det är viktigt att kunna ha de diskussionerna. Jag hoppas t.ex. att du kan vara enig med mig om vikten att t.ex. begränsa yttrandefriheten i krigstid (loose lips sink ships), och att vi kan vara eniga om att det inte är någon absolut rättighet - men nog något väldigt viktigt som det måste finnas särskilt tunga skäl för att kunna kränkas. Det är inte absoluta rättigheter, utan det måste balanseras.

Just nu bemöter vi något enastående. COVID är ett av de allmännaste dödsorsakerna i Sverige, och ett hot av den typen vi bemöter kanske en gång i seklet. Det är otroligt allvarligt, och vi måste kunna justera oss enligt det och tala om de materiella inverkningarna först och främst.

Clearly Vegas doesn’t really fit the theme of the trip but I figured it could help if I was feeling fatigued with so many 4+ hour rides. Plus Zion is one of my favorites parks so an extra night would have been ideal.

Here’s the full itinerary 

Day 1: Oakland to Anaheim - breweries 


Day 2: Anaheim to Joshua Tree with a stop in Palm Springs


Day 3: J Tree to Tucson with a visit to Saguaro National Park


Day 4: Tucson to White Sands National Park staying the night in Las Cruces 


Day 5: Las Cruces to El Paso to Guadalupe Mountains National Park where I hiked Texas’s largest peak to Carlsbad, NM. The hike wasn’t planned so it was a little ambitious on minimal water, but worth while.


Day 6: Carlsbad Caverns National Park first thing in the morning to Roswell to Albuquerque 


Day 7: Albuquerque to Taos


Day 8: Taos to Santa Fe


Day 9: Santa Fe to Petrified Forest National Park staying the night in Winslow, AZ


Day 10: Winslow to Zion National Park with a stop at Horseshoe Bend 


Day 11: Zion - Angels Landing, about 7 miles of the Narrows, Emerald Pools


Day 12: one more Zion hike in the early AM then to Las Vegas where I was luckily upgraded to a pretty nice suite at the Bellagio 


Day 13: Vegas to Death Valley- Badwater Basin, Artist Palette, Mesquite Sand Dunes


Day 14: Death Valley to Inyo National Forest for a 10 mile hike to a night in Mammoth. The original plan was to meet some friends at Yosemite instead of Mammoth but the campsite reservations were canceled due to COVID.


Day 15: Mammoth to home (SF Bay Area)

The biggest issue is I’m a distance runner so I had to replace a lot of my running time with drive time. A couple random facts: in total the trip was just under 4000 miles and I visited 20 breweries. 10/10 would do it again but preferably with company

And for the most part these people will accept any evidence that contradicts with their own findings if the foundation is solid. If that isnt the case peers will shred anything if it misses the scientific specs.
So there is a willingness to adapt to new findings. That is progess.

This has been very explicitly shown with covid. In the beginning there werent as many findings and people were clueless of what can be done. But now we have some idea whats going. And the public sees it as big conspiracy because of contradicting information in the beginning.

A couple of things, even though you can find a RTX 2070 8GB for about the same price now, the RTX 2060 Super actually outperforms it in many games/applications due to having superior memory. Personally I would go with the RTX 2060 Super but the performance difference isn't huge so whichever one you can find available and for cheaper would be fine.

Secondly, because of COVID-19, it's now actually more EXPENSIVE to build your own PC than finding a comparable pre-built due to shortages in parts. I estimate you are overpaying at least $200 with your parts list which could be applied toward a better monitor or webcam, etc. At the very least, you should upgrade your 720p webcam to Logitech's C920 1080p model which is far superior. You could also apply some of the $200+ saved to getting Sceptre's 30"" 2560x1080 Ultrawide 200Hz model for just another $80.

Just as an example, here's a pre-built from Best Buy for $999.99 that is pretty close to the specs you're looking for: [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/skytech-gaming-shadow-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-5-3600-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-super-500gb-ssd-black/6409025.p?skuId=6409025](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/skytech-gaming-shadow-gaming-desktop-amd-ryzen-5-3600-16gb-memory-nvidia-geforce-rtx-2060-super-500gb-ssd-black/6409025.p?skuId=6409025) 

Keep in mind it comes with Win 10 pre-installed so that adds another $100 to its value since your parts list doesn't include the OS. So even with adding another 2 x 8GB RAM for a total of 32GB and a 2TB HDD which combined will cost you about $100, and adding $40 for the upgraded 1080p webcam and $80 for the 30"" Ultrawide 200Hz monitor, you still come out ahead by about $30!",,2020-08-12 07:01:41,{},g16wkvs,False,t3_i7mrag,False,True,t3_i7mrag,/r/buildapc/comments/i7mrag/hey_guys_so_im_a_14_year_old_who_saved_up_money/g16wkvs/,1597217934.0,1,True,False,buildapc,t5_2rnve,,0.0,[],1597208501.0,,,
