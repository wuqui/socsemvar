[],,DurkaTurk02,,,[],,,,text,t2_1febzh7k,False,False,[],"&gt;In terms of overall... any surprise that two biggest economies, win in total spend on Corona response measures? Especially given Germanies fiscal buffer they had available ?

No, it is surprising that where common agreements were made to limit that spending to ensure fair competition, that one country has been allowed to spend so much. Going back to the analogy, they have been able to buy the ability to travel up snakes. Why is Germany get any of it at all when they have spent an additional trillion (approved by the EU) on their recovery when other nations do not have that ability? Isn't the point of that fund to ensure Europe is healthier and to equalise the abilities of recovery each goverment has?

&gt;Some of those ""rules"" are just rules of reality though, and issues that would exist no matter what... Poor countries will always be less able to spend than richer countries. 

&gt;Then there's the composition, Italy/Spain (in particular) has been hit hard due to Corona being a heavy hit on tourism. 

The single market here is the game. In order to take part in that game we are told that everyone is limited so that poorer countries can compete. That is the entire point of this whole state aid debacle. To limit that spending to prevent uneven competition. Noone is arguing here that Germany has/hasn't the fiscal capability over others to do that. Only the rules of the game are set up to allow the wealthier countries to gain advantages (travel up snakes) and the catch up mechanics seem to benefit the countries that are taking advantage.

&gt;But the problem here that some of those benefits, are benefits due to internal fiscal policies of germany, for example running a surplus, allowing them a huge buffer. Same for Sweden/denmark (and norway) which also have been spending big during all this.

&gt;Then there's the question of how much/little ""state aid"" is required 

&gt;Furlough &amp; welfare schemes aren't considered State aid in the normal sense.

All of this supports the idea that there is inherrant bias within the rules of the game. These should not be questions. The answers should be simple.

Why should a country running a surplus give it the oppurtunity to unbalance the competition in the single market? Surely the whole point of the EU single market is that all nations can compete evenly.

&gt;In the end, doesn't support that EU has treated UK more harshly on state aid. Nor is there evidence for that. Especially as you mix two things together.... and mixing things together that shouldn't be mixed... 

How would you prove that the four people who do not have the ability to move up the snake are being treated harshly? There would be no evidence of that within the game. Any decisions made (i.e the four not being allowed to move up snakes) is within the rules of the game. I suppose judging the arguement you can say it is fair if everyone has the ability to buy the ability to move up snakes, but is that fair when you are well aware some do not have that ability to do so?

As for mixing things together that shouldn't be mixed? The Covid recovery fund is being used as an instrument of state aid, and despite Germany spending a trillion (approved) they are still receiving the 4th most money (just under 20% of the total allocated funds.) How can this be justified? How can you claim the single market is fair when one country can be allowed to spend so much internally, then claw 20% of the fund designed to assist the 26 member states?

Again, this is just part of where the bias is. I am not claiming that Germany, France or any other member state is doing anything wrong. The rules of the game allow them to do this. They can buy their way up snakes. Just from the outside we can clearly see that others can't, and that despite a catch up mechanic being in place (Covid fund) it seems to benefit the ones already benefiting from being able to buy their way up snakes rather than giving everyone the ability to do so, which is surely what it is for.",,,2020-10-01 12:27:51,{},g7a1x8i,False,t3_j34dp2,False,True,t1_g79yosv,/r/ukpolitics/comments/j34dp2/britain_eu_split_on_state_aid_in_crunch_week_of/g7a1x8i/,1601555282,1,True,False,ukpolitics,t5_2qhcv,,0,[],1601548071.0,,,

Small pox, truly one of the worst viral diseases of all time, was dropped into the US in mediocre metropolitan areas of Kansas, ""terrorist or state actors"" since the only countries that have small pox samples are US or Russia.

Small pox as a incubation period and once you get it its like 30-40% lethal with like a 60% chance of going blind after.

within one week the small pox would have taken hold on the US, only days before we realized. 

LEssons

* Vaccines were not the answer. There is not enough, and ramping up wasn't enough

* Quarantining would always turn violent. People would attack national guard.

* Everything would be in a shortage. The US would not play with ""quarantining"" it would be martial law

Fortunately, as one of the grimmest pandemic scenarios the US as publicly run, it proves the US has the plans, capability, and agility to enforce the draconian measures CCP had to.

What this means is COVID is nothing like this. At all. The national guard was considered, but it was not necesarry as this is not small pox. It means COVID is not world ending. IT means I don't know why there is such misinformation being portrayed, because the govt is very aware of the disease and very aware of how to handle pandemics. Incompetence seems unlikely. Either we're intentionally being exposed, or this is a ruse.

I think it's bad for my own reasons. The universe was capable of producing and containing intelligence and in your dreamworld it no longer will. That absence is bad enough for me. No chair has ever been sentient. 

&gt;Whatever you call it, there's nothing wrong with it. There's no crisis that needs to be fixed which would justify the creation of suffering.

There's nothing wrong with it to you. Don't assume that for me or other people.

&gt;But a non-sentient chair is just as much in need of sentience as a human that doesn't exist. Just because you can make sentient humans, that doesn't mean that there are sentient human minds floating around the ether groaning and wailing until they get their chance to be incarnated into a body.

There's no ""ether"", but there is the possibility of making humans. That obviously makes it different from an impossible chair. 

&gt;That would make you a torturer of the worst order.

So does it make no difference if I make an apathetic sentient chair or a chair which only experiences pain for its entire existence?

&gt;How is that arbitrary. I bet that in the real world, you would not be happy to have other people to take outrageous non-consensual risks with your welfare on the premise that their risk might work out well for you. And if the ethics that I've presented don't apply to you, you still have no justification for subjecting someone else to your sense of what is a risk worth taking. 

Of course it's arbitrary. You're one of a minority who thinks these risks are ""outrageous"". 

I have plenty of justification for someone subjecting someone else to what's a risk worth taking. Doctors and experts are the only ones who can determine how much of a risk it is to open schools with the current COVID situation. An ignorant person can't. 

&gt;It's not your welfare to gamble with. It's not your own psychology that you are creating. It's a new person whose values, sensitivities and preferences are unknown until they come into existence.

Yes, and you don't know whether not bringing them into existence is preferable to an existence with pain. People have the right to make many decisions for their children because their children don't have the knowledge to make those decisions. It's why children aren't allowed to vote, or own guns in the U.S., or drink, or drive. It's why if you ask a child if they want to have sex and they say yes, it's still rape to have sex with them because their minds aren't formed enough for their consent in that to be valid.

States’ rights now took the form of Jim Crow, America’s apartheid.

Jim Crow being apartheid is true. 

But it's not true that this is something that happened independently of the Federal government.  There was a huge amount of institutional racism going on the Federal level and the Supreme Court was just a small part of it. 

Wilson, for example, did things like re-segregating the military.  The entire progressive era was marked with racism at all levels of government.  

Especially the ideas of evolution of the human species and related (falty) medical science laid the groundwork for much of the progressive's ideas about the world.  Eugenics movement was very much a part of this era and things like minimum wage to drive minorities out of the workplace and forced sterilization was something that existed in most states. Especially the more 'progressive ones'. 

It was the American progressives, like Wilson, that went on to inspire Hilter to his 'greatness'. Specifically when it came to the new American administrative state,  massive propaganda programs, and eugenics.  All of which were pioneered in the USA. 

So this is not a issue of 'states rights' being used for racist policies.  This certainly happened, but it's missing the point.  They were completely supported by the Federal government.  And acting like this is a southern state issue is ignoring the wider reality of what was going on post-civil war in the USA.

&gt; Patchworks of state laws failed to provide effective regulation over a tightly integrated capitalist economy spanning the entire continent, especially once the Great Depression struck.

What made the great depression the great depression wasn't due to lack of controls over capitalism.

What made it so terrible and so long lasting was things like the Farm Board protectionist policies to protect farmer's profits from international competition. They did everything they could to drive up domestic profits.  As their policies produced more and more dire results they resorted to even more extreme measures like buying up massive amounts of produce and destroying it to keep prices of exports high.   

The result was the development of agricultural export markets in South America at the same time Europe was recovering from the devastation from WW1.   Which meant the progressive protectionists policies destroyed any semblance of the free market and doomed it.

It was due to the Federal Reserve monetary policy as well.  And the 'New Deal'.  The attempts at bail-outs and make-busy work that consumed vast amount of national resources extended the depression from months into decades. 

This is not 'lack of controls over capitalism'. 

This is Federal and state governments building up a massive crony corporate state and then mismanaging it into the ground.  The 'Great Society' was the cause, not the solution.

&gt; Many white southerners never forgave the Warren Court for empowering the central government at the expense of the states. They joined Republicans in the North and West who were convinced that the expansion of federal-government power across the New Deal, World War II, and Great Society eras had violated the Constitution and was destroying American liberty.

Southern Democrats remained Southern Democrats well into the 1970s.  The historic filibuster against civil rights in 1964 was lead by Democrats.  Including Al Gore Sr. 

The 'new narrative' that is trying to explain the mass defection of south from Democrat to Republican party is that it didn't happen in the late 1970s, but in fact was something that was ongoing since the 1930s or some such bullshit like that. 

&gt; Over time, Reagan’s successors Newt Gingrich and Mitch McConnell stripped the central state of its dynamism, frustrating the efforts of Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama to build on the legacies of Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. The federal government’s dysfunction, so evident in Trump’s handling of the pandemic, is not solely of his own creation; rather, his administration is a symptom of the paralysis that Republicans have sowed at the federal level for decades.

This is bullshit. 

The reason the Federal government 'lacks dynamism' is not due to Mitch McConnell.  It's that the legacy of Roosevelt and Johnson is a complete fabrication.  They didn't help the country, they didn't save the country.  Their major accomplishments were making the economy worse and getting us into the Vietnam war. 

These people were complete assholes: 

https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB132/tapes.htm

The Federal government never accomplished the things people claim in the Great Depression.  It was the major cause of it and is why it took till after the end of WW2 before the country was able to finally recover. 

Now the Federal government is 2.1 million people.  And extended Federal government, in terms of people that directly depend on government spending, is probably in the tens of millions. 

A organization of that size cannot be dynamic.  All it can be is completely disfuctional.  All time, effort, and resources gets devoted in just making sure the day to day operations is not completely fucked.  There is nothing anybody can do to improve it.  It's only going to get worse the bigger it gets.  There is no solution for the Federal government.  There is no way to fix it.  It's completely fucked. 

Things like Trump's response to covid has nothing to do with his decisions or policies.  He is just the guy standing at the front of a train waving the flags.

I home educated my daughter at 9, then at 11, then full time from aged 13, so I am familiar with education law, home education and disability provision,

Do you have a supportive GP who can write to your school/college and let them know you ME/CFS is so bad you cannot attend - in the past this should trigger the Hospital School's involvement, in theory anyway, depends on where you are! These Covid days they should let you continue your studies online. I feel their is hostility out their for children to shield, even with something obviously putting them at risk, so if your place of learning is told you cannot go to school due to ill health they will accept it - again, in principle. Do get your specialist clinic to write a support letter too, but it should come from your GP first.

I'm in Oxfordshire, which has one of the most appallingly funding social services and education services in the country. I get no help. I got no help for my daughter. It sounds like you are getting some help and you have supportive parents. And as long as you/your parents keep the school/college updated on your health needs - ME/CFS and housebound and unable to get into school, even if the nasty law gets triggered and your parents get some threatening letters, the actual health reasons will catch up and the prosecution will not be taken further (I have been there with my daughter 4 times, threatened with fines or prison, despite her being genuinely unable to come into school - you just have to keep providing medical evidence until the school is no longer under pressure to threaten you - attendance law is a big scary stick but rarely follows through)

Anyway, from what you've just said, it sounds like you are too ill to attend, so just stop going and let your GP, specialist and parents deal with getting the evidence in as soon as they can. there is an advice to parents re school attendance and law on the ME Association website you could find for your parents which might help too.
