[],,T-Corona,,,[],,,,text,t2_5yfleb6r,False,False,[],"KOLKATA: Almost an entire village in Purulia district is starving as ration cards of around 50 families of tribal daily wagers are mortgaged with the local money lenders. The beneficiaries are now being deprived of the free food grains through public distribution system (PDS) as announced by Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee in the wake of COVID-19 threat.

The poor labourers in the Bengal‚Äôs most backward region had to deposit their ration cards, which are considered as the only ‚Äòvaluable asset‚Äô that they possess, as guarantee for borrowing money ranging from Rs 5,000 to Rs 20,000. The poor tribals are compelled to do so for either buying train tickets to go to other states as migrants labourers, bear treatment expenditure or arrange funds for daughter‚Äôs wedding.

As interest of the loan amount, the money lenders collect food grains from local ration dealers against the ration cards of the poor borrowers and sell it in open market, sometimes to the original card-holders too.

The exploitation of the poor by their rich neighbours emerged at Sarjumatu village in Purulia‚Äôs Jhalda-I block, around 310 km from Kolkata, a small hamlet inhabited by a 60 odd families, who either work as outbound migrant labourers in other states or earn their bread and butter by going to nearby small towns to work as daily wage earners.

Most of the migrant labourers returned to the village before the lockdown was announced. Both the daily wage earners who returned home and those who used to work in the area are now starving along with their families as they have nothing to eat, nothing to cook.

""The chief minister announced free food grain for people like us till September. The ration card is required to avail the facility. When I requested the person from whom I had borrowed Rs 5,000 for going to Odisha one year ago to work as a labourer with folded hands, he turned down my plea saying I would have to repay the loan first. I have no money to meet his demand. I started begging and with my collection, I fed my five-member family. But now no one is helping me. I, my wife and our three children are starving for past two days,"" said Suresh Kalindi.

Suresh borrowed the money to buy train tickets to Odisha and secure accommodation in the neighbouring state till he gets a job there. Before receiving the money, he had to go to the local ration dealer and authorise the money lender verbally for receiving food grains on his behalf.   

The members of the 50 odd families are not entitled to get the facility the chief minister announced for those who do not have ration cards. ""The food coupon is being issued to those who do not have ration cards. Since, we were issued ration cards, we are not allowed to get the food coupons,"" said Jagabandhu Kalindi, who had to borrow Rs 22,000 from a local money lender for treatment of his son and daughter‚Äôs wedding.

""I used to go to Jhalda sub-division headquarters to work as a daily wager. But because of the lockdown, I cannot go anywhere. Earlier, I had to buy the same food grain that the money lender procured from ration shop using my card. Now, I have no money to buy it,"" Gaur Kalindi.

Bengal chief minister had announced free ration for 7.85 crore people in Bengal till September.

Rahul Majumdar, the district magistrate, Purulia, said the beneficiaries violated government norms by mortgaging ration cards and the money lenders too committed the same offence by receiving it. ""I have asked the local administration to intervene and sort out the issue,"" he said.",,2020-04-10 04:56:21,{},fmyso6r,True,t3_fy8qj9,False,True,t3_fy8qj9,/r/IndiaSpeaks/comments/fy8qj9/bengal_village_starves_as_ration_cards_mortgaged/fmyso6r/,1586495447,1,True,False,IndiaSpeaks,t5_3d4x4,0,[],1586487381.0,,,

The going rate for nurses in 2000 was $34/hr...and why has that not changed?  S/Because we‚Äôre giving service not engaging in a career choice./s

One of the other insidious elements is the co-dependency effect which some nurses end up internalizing to their personal lives and beyond.  How many nurses do you know who are utterly entwines with an SO that requires being taken care of?  Management can and will capitalize on this.

There‚Äôs a reason most places do little or nothing for nurses week anymore.  There‚Äôs a reason they expect you to give up your personal life for the job.  There‚Äôs a reason you aren‚Äôt validated for your concerns and squeezed for more at every step.  It‚Äôs all to foster a culture in which nurses are not and never will feel empowered.  They capitalize on it.

The hero crap is just another extension of all of that with the added bonus of legitimizing the expectation of our deaths when they do inevitably happen after unnecessary covid exposure due to shit PPE rules (though management and doctors will have theirs...priorities...).  As well as using big sweaty balls of hot air to bolster the ranks instead of action, and solid things you can put your hands on, like PPE.

By Ben Riley-Smith, US Editor 9 April 2020

Negotiations on a UK-US free trade deal have been postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus crisis, raising fresh doubts about whether an agreement can be struck before Donald Trump faces re-election in November. 

The Telegraph understands that formal talks were due to start after years of preparation in the week beginning March 23, with Liz Truss, the International Trade Secretary, flying out to Washington DC with her top trade officials. 

However the plans, which would have seen around 100 politicians and negotiators discuss terms over multiple days, were cancelled along with events across all aspects of public life as lockdowns were announced due to Covid-19. 

There is no new date agreed for a restart, despite political will on both sides, with the UK and US governments in emergency management mode as they tackle the twin crises of a worldwide pandemic and a potential global recession. 

One idea being considered is to begin the talks virtually, with teams of officials negotiating through video conferences - though there is an acceptance from some involved that such a process would be less efficient.

Both Ms Truss and Bob Leithauser, the US trade representative, have talked since the Covid-19 outbreak emerged. Ms Truss is understood to favour beginning negotiations as soon as is realistically possible. 

Yet the delay has created new pressure on an already tight timeline, with the UK hoping for a ‚Äúcomprehensive‚Äù trade deal agreed before Mr Trump faces the US public in the presidential election less than seven months away. 

Failure to do so could see the UK lose its chance to capitalise on Mr Trump‚Äôs strong and vocal support for a trade deal, given he could be voted from office on November 3. 

The US president, who backed Brexit before the referendum, repeatedly told Theresa May and then Boris Johnson he is eager to reach an agreement to ease Britain‚Äôs path out of the European Union.

The position on trade talks from the Democrat all but certain to be taking on Mr Trump at the election, the former US vice president Joe Biden, is much less clear. 

One of the most senior Democrats in Congress, House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi, has adopted a cooler stance to talks, threatening to vote down any agreement that undermines the Northern Ireland peace settlement. 

Both sides of the Congress - the Democrat-held House and the Republican-held Senate - will need to vote through the legislation for the trade deal to come into force, meaning Ms Pelosi‚Äôs warning had political bite. 

Other complications are looming on the horizon. Next summer, the US president loses the power to negotiate trade deals, known as the Trade Promotion Authority, and will need it reapproved by Congress. 

There is no guarantee that will happen, whoever is president at that point, with long delays common in the past. UK negotiators see the summer 2021 as a hard deadline, given the uncertainty that will follow.

Delays in talks between Britain and the EU could also impact discussions with Washington. The two are interlinked, with compromises in one set of talks potentially impacting the other. 

There is growing speculation that the date the Brexit transition period finishes, currently the end of this year, may have to be delayed, creating extended uncertainty just as UK negotiators hope to sign and seal an agreement with the US. 

Yet there are also some hopes on the UK side that the economic slowdown approaching could provide fresh impetus for a deal designed to lower barriers and boost trade. 

A UK government source said: ‚ÄúBoth sides are keen to ensure trade talks between the UK and US progress asap. Free trade is integral to global recovery from this crisis.‚Äù",,2020-04-09 20:51:46,{},fmxiafi,True,t3_fy0e9y,False,True,t3_fy0e9y,/r/brealism/comments/fy0e9y/ukus_trade_talks_postponed_indefinitely_as/fmxiafi/,1586469714,1,True,False,brealism,t5_3f9cs,0,[],1586458306.0,,,

2 ‚Äì What If the Other Parent Is in Another State? Can I Still Exercise Time With the Kids?

Changing custody/possession across state lines is always more difficult especially now with travel related restrictions in place and some states preventing the entry of citizens from other states where the pandemic outbreak is high. Again, generally most courts state that the possession schedules should not change in light of COVID-19 related restrictions. However, if your child usually travels by plane to see the other parent, exercise caution and drive to exchange custody, if possible. Alternatively, you can agree to give the out of state parent make up time with the child after COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. If you and the other parent have not been using technology such as Facetime or Zoom, try to allow your child to call the other parent frequently using video technology so the child can ‚Äúsee‚Äù both parents as often as possible. Also, we are all stuck at home and sometimes need a break. If your parenting situation allows, you can offer the parent not in possession daily Facetime/Zoom interaction with the child to help with homework and generally keeping children entertained while everyone adjusts to the new stay at home orders.

The fact that our news agencies notice that people are dying for instance. They've always been dying. Pollution is a huge factor it turns out with COVID -- but, maybe it's always been a huge factor but we put up with it and ignored it for \*ahem\*, economic reasons.

I think it's estimated that pollution kills 30,000 - 60,000 more people per year than who would otherwise die. So, if we lose 30,000 nationally to COVID, but the lack of commerce made the air cleaner -- it might be statistically no less dangerous than normal life in our country.

People will get pissed at me for saying that. But you know, they shut down traffic in Boston for two people killed by a bomber. Probably had less deaths due to traffic accidents because of it.

As you say, the FED has been intervening decisively in the credit markets and has been providing liquidity. After last Thursday, any tensions in the credit markest have eased significantly. 

Insurance companies have many ways to chase yield and have been dealing with low interest rates for years. It‚Äôs certainly not particularly good for business, but they are well prepared and the NAIC has pretty strict regulations regarding risk management and asset allocation. 

The FED is buying up ABS and MBS on the secondary market, so it is moving the risk of default onto its own balance sheet. Besides, Banks have record excess cash on their books, so they are well prepared for a wave of defaults. 

Yes, I have seen the numbers regarding real estate. It‚Äôs not a market I know well, but seems temporary at best. Again, the FED is intervening here by buying up junk structured securities and granting cheap loans to high street business. Besides, you are conveniently leaving out that in a normal month, ca. 20% of renters do not pay rent. 

Giving WeWork as an example is ridiculous. It was one of the most hyped and leveraged unicorns out there and obviously they will have a hard time recovering. In fact, I agree that office space and probably brick and mortar retail space will be much less in demand over the coming years. But that doesn‚Äôt automatically mean we‚Äôll have a broader economic downturn. The economy as a whole is been moving away from brick and mortar and with this sudden wave in forced remote-work, my guess is it will also slowly move away from your typical office environment.

As the other person pointed out, there are many different conspiracies, including the outlandish ""5G triggers latent COVID-19 infections delivered by prior injections"" to the  at-least-testable-hypothesis ""weakened/affected immune system"".

However, even for the hypothesis, it seems very implausible. This is really saying that a certain frequency and amplitude is going to have an effect on a physiological response, which is really just a bunch of chemical reactions. If one is going to hypothesize that this EMR is going to interfere with these kinds of reactions, then it should be possible to demonstrate this effect in an experiment or have a hypothesis on why this particular kind of EMR will interact.

I will point out that the people who seem to be promoting these hypotheses have essentially no understanding of how the immune system works, at any level of scientific detail, so it's kind of ridiculous that they think that it is a plausible hypothesis. The fact that someone can make a grammatical English sentence that sounds plausible does not mean it is a good hypothesis. In what specific way does it ""weaken or 'affect' the immune response?""

How do you know that? Do you know why we have that death rate? If your numbers are far from accurate, you cannot cite those figures. They are, simply put, false.

  


&gt; How do you expect death rate to go down with mass testing and more cases?

Read my comment again. If you think mass testing is for getting the death rate down, you are completely mistaken. The \*real\* death rate will remain what it is whther we test or not. Viruses don't check the figures.

  


For example:

Let's say there are 1000 **real cases,** of which we only test 50%. Let's say the real amount of deaths is 200, in which we only counted 150.

  


Now tell me: did the number of deaths and cases decline because we didn't test them?

&gt; A few weeks ago, death rate was 4.9% and this week, it's at 6.2%. I want to see the death rate going down with or without mass testing.

You can't say the death rate is going down if you don't have accurate numbers. You think those deaths are the only cases of CV19 deaths? You think those are the only cases of CV19?

  


If you don't do mass testibg, you don't have a hope of getting accurate numbers. Ergo you can't look at the figures and say the death/recovery rates improve/decline.

  


How do you know the death rate is down **when you can't rely on the figures?** A covid-19 death is a covid-19 death regardless if it was counted or not.

Banned or ineligible lenders cannot comment here. B) CHECK your lenders r/borrow history by clicking [here.](https://www.loanmanager.co/lender-check/) Do this for every loan request you recieve. C) Are they **BLACKLISTED** or asking for **PROHIBITED ITEMS/INFORMATION** (see [THIS LINK](https://www.reddit.com/r/borrow/wiki/lender_blacklist_prohibited_info))? Message moderators immediately D) Are they eligible (90+ day account, 1000+ karma, not banned) and active (any big account activity gaps?).

I have been issued into a mandatory quarantine and am awaiting testing for covid 19.. and unfortunately have been unable to work for 9 day now and am in a tight financial spot until the stimulus check comes in. 

I will be able to repay the same day I recieve the stimulus check, but would really appreciate any help I can get until then.

It's a bit of an apples and oranges comparison.we also have access to far more knowledge, and the ability to disseminate that information to people much easier. In 1918, there was a good chance that people went the entire pandemic without even knowing about it.

We know that covid 19 can be killed with a 60% isopropyl alcohol solution. Society is far more informed and infrastructurally sound to deal with this than they were in 1918.

I have a buddy that works for a flooring company. They don't do anything other than flooring renovations, but are deemed essential workers. One store gets to stay open, but the other store has to close, despite both being retail locations. There is so many inconsistencies to the argument that I can't just blindly support it.
