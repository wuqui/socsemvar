Είναι χαρακτηριστική η δήλωση του προέδρου των γιατρών του νοσοκομείου ΑΧΕΠΑ, ο οποίος τόνισε πως το σύστημα έχει «κρασάρει» και πως δυστυχώς θα πρέπει να γίνεται επιλογή για τους ασθενής που θα διασωληνωθούν. 
&gt;

&gt; 
&gt; Είναι ενδεικτικό πως **μόνο κατά το Σαββατοκύριακο οι εισαγωγές προσέγγισαν τις 700 και περισσότεροι από 2.500 άνθρωποι νοσηλεύονται πλέον με κορονοϊό.** 
&gt; 
&gt; Σύμφωνα με νοσοκομειακές πηγές,**τουλάχιστον 10 ασθενείς διασωληνώνονται την ημέρα.** 
&gt; 
&gt; Ενδεικτική της κατάστασης είναι και η δήλωση του προέδρου του Πανελλήνιου Ιατρικού Συλλόγου, Θανάση Εξαδάκτυλου, ο οποίος μιλώντας στο iatropedia τόνισε πως «στη Θεσσαλονίκη η κατάσταση είναι πολύ επιβαρυμένη.

&gt; 
&gt; Όπως επεσήμανε ο Θανάσης Τσιούλης **η ίδια κατάσταση επικρατεί και στα άλλα νοσοκομεία της Θεσσαλονίκης** αφού το σύστημα έχει «κρασάρει». Κατά τη συνέντευξή του στο OPEN, ρωτήθηκε για το εάν η κατάσταση έχει φτάσει σε τέτοιο οριακό σημείο ώστε να πρέπει να γίνεται επιλογή  ποιοι ασθενείς θα διασωληνωθούν. Η απάντησή του αποτυπώνει την τραγική κατάσταση: 
&gt; 
&gt; **«Είμαστε πραγματικά σε αυτή την κρίσιμη κατάσταση. Δεν υπάρχουν περιθώρια.. Αναγκαστικά, πλέον, θα πρέπει γίνει με πολύ αυστηρότερα κριτήρια η επιλογή. Ηλικιακά, βαρύτητα νοσημάτων και άλλα κριτήρια. Δεν υπάρχει χώρος. Υπάρχει κορεσμός»**.

Υπάρχει μεγάλη πίεση στο σύστημα υγείας. Είναι ακριβώς όπως τα λέμε και ίσως και χειρότερα. Κάθε μέρα επιβαρύνεται. Οι ασθενείς συσσωρεύονται στις μονάδες Covid και σε λίγο καιρό δεν θα έχουμε πού να τους νοσηλεύσουμε» τόνισε μιλώντας στον ΣΚΑΪ. Όπως είπε, ακόμη δεν φαίνονται τα αποτελέσματα του lockdown, αλλά η εικόνα είναι αυτή των προηγούμενων δέκα ημερών.

&gt; Ο Χ.

A quick glance at the list and the big difference in prices between Montreal and Halifax told me the list was so bad as to be completely useless. I have no idea how the prices got set higher than what they’ve ever been here—doesn’t make sense to me. I'm not aware of any reliable site that shows price differences between Canadian cites. Statscan CPI is the best we have but it is only by province as far as I know. It currently shows the difference in their basket of goods being 3.6% cheaper in PQ than NS. https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1810000402

Every place has achievers and defeatists. I think the dichotomy between these two is even stronger in Halifax and you can find plenty of evidence to back up either view. A good example is to peruse the Halifax ACORN site then check out halifaxpartnership.com. If you read the ACORN site before a job interview you will not get the job. If you instead read the latter your chances will be much better. Attitudes of people can be ascertained in an instant and it makes all the difference in the world. I've been seeing doom and gloom articles and studies about the impending collapse of Halifax or Canada or the world for many decades. I pay them no attention. If something ever sticks, we will have to deal with it then as we may well have to over Covid fallout—no one knows how this is going to affect us financially. I do know that Canada and Germany are the only G7 nations to have retained their triple A credit rating but that may not mean anything. I do think the world has a very good chance of coming out better in the end (after we get over the hump). 
My agenda is that I'm sick of the people who try to claim that Halifax is not doing any better than small town Atlantic Canada, who are suffering from out migration and lack of jobs. Halifax has being doing good for many decades and they're kicked it into doing great in recent years (pre-Covid). I don’t know what the answer is for dying small towns and rural areas across the country but is is a sad situation.

No I’m not and never will be a landlord or property renter in any more—not for me. You certainly don’t have to be one to be against rent control. I’m pretty sure majority of people know rent control is self defeating. I also know housing is a critical issue in Halifax right now across all price points and that it is certainly hardest on those looking for affordable housing. I’m paying hundreds more a month than I would like too myself but obviously that is not as bad as someone not finding a place period. 

It is unusual for Halifax but there is nothing unusual about a low vacancy rate and a booming hosing market in Canada, other Canadian cities have had prolonged periods of this for longer than I know of. But I see the problem is only solvable by an immediate uptick in building development. We need more development and rent control stifles development—no exceptions. You can’t possible have government artificially mandating lower rent and not have it negatively affect the amount of development. Though maybe there could be something done, at least temporarily, about renovictions. But buildings need to be renovated so it not an easy solution either.  All development helps. Build a building which has $2000 rent and some people will move into it from their $1600 places and some will move into those empty $1600 places from their $1200 places and so on. But we need to pick up the pace yesterday.

It would be nice if some could build new affordable housing buildings but that is financially risky and headache-prone. It would be quite expensive for Halifax to start buildings masses of public housing such as Toronto. I don’t know what the answer is other than to get more buildings up as fast as possible regardless of the price point. Most developments are paying into an affordable housing fund so the more the merrier…build, build, build.

""Disposable medical masks (also known as surgical masks) are loose-fitting devices that were designed to be worn by medical personnel to protect accidental contamination of patient wounds, and to protect the wearer against splashes or sprays of bodily fluids. There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure. Our systematic review found no significant effect of face masks on transmission of laboratory-confirmed influenza.""

""More research on cloth masks is needed to inform their use as an alternative to surgical masks/respirators in the event of shortage or high-demand situations. To our knowledge, only 1 randomized controlled trial has been conducted to examine the efficacy of cloth masks in healthcare settings, and the results do not favor use of cloth masks.""

http://archive.today/4SGYt

New England Journal of Medicine, 2nd paragraph 
""We know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is therefore minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.""

BMJ
The rates of all infection outcomes were highest in the cloth mask arm, with the rate of ILI statistically significantly higher in the cloth mask arm (relative risk (RR)=13.00, 95% CI 1.69 to 100.07) compared with the medical mask arm. Penetration of cloth masks by particles was almost 97% and medical masks 44%.
This study is the first RCT of cloth masks, and the results caution against the use of cloth masks.

University of Minnesota CIDRAP
""We do not recommend requiring the general public who do not have symptoms of COVID-19-like illness to routinely wear cloth or surgical masks because:
There is no scientific evidence they are effective in reducing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission
Their use may result in those wearing the masks to relax other distancing efforts because they have a sense of protection
We need to preserve the supply of surgical masks for at-risk healthcare workers.
Sweeping mask recommendations—as many have proposed—will not reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission, as evidenced by the widespread practice of wearing such masks in Hubei province, China, before and during its mass COVID-19 transmission experience earlier this year. Our review of relevant studies indicates that cloth masks will be ineffective at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, whether worn as source control or as PPE.""

PCR test and the pandemic that wasn't:

“Because we had cases we thought were pertussis and because we had vulnerable patients at the hospital, we lowered our threshold,” she said. Anyone who had a cough got a P.C.R. test, and so did anyone with a runny nose who worked with high-risk patients like infants.

“That’s how we ended up with 134 suspect cases,” Dr. Kirkland said. And that, she added, was why 1,445 health care workers ended up taking antibiotics and 4,524 health care workers at the hospital, or 72 percent of all the health care workers there, were immunized against whooping cough in a matter of days.""

Medical supplies for trauma or debilitating things should be bought in some sort of bulk, in my opinion. Sure these days if you live in a city you can amazon anything to your house in a day or 2 or perhaps even just online from someplace local but having to go out and get more basic medical supplies when your injured sucks balls, not to mention medical supplies bought locally unless you have an actual supply store close to you are quite a bit more expensive.

O salto ocorreu por causa da pela liberação de dados represados do estado de São Paulo, que desde 6 de novembro não divulgava informações completas sobre a doença em seu território. As mortes informadas por SP (190) representam 33,6% das registradas desta quarta, enquanto que os casos (24.936) são 52,2% dos relatados hoje.

O Rio de Janeiro, que não apresentava números de mortes desde 7 de novembro, voltou a divulgar. No entanto, Minas Gerais segue sem apresentar dados de óbitos e alega problema em seu sistema.

No total, o país já perdeu 163.406 vidas para a Covid-19 e 5.749.007 pessoas já se infectaram pelo Sars-CoV-2. A média móvel desta quarta-feira foi de 319. 

**Infográfico**: [Números do coronavírus no Brasil e no mundo](https://infograficos.oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/numeros-do-coronavirus-no-brasil-e-no-mundo.html)

A falta de informações durante a semana afetou diretamente a média móvel, que faz uma média entre o número de mortes do dia e dos seis anteriores. Ela é comparada com média de duas semanas atrás para indicar se há tendência de alta, estabilidade ou queda. O cálculo é um recurso estatístico para conseguir enxergar a tendência dos dados abafando o ""ruído"" causado pelos finais de semana, quando a notificação de mortes se reduz por escassez de funcionários em plantão.

A iniciativa dos veículos da mídia foi criada a partir de inconsistências nos dados apresentados pelo Ministério da Saúde.

**Médias móveis**: [Veja detalhes do seu estado](https://infograficos.oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/painel-do-coronavirus-nos-estados.html)

Em seu boletim diário, a pasta registrou 48.331 novos casos confirmados e 544 mortes. Os números totais da pandemia não foram atualizados devido a problemas técnicos na rede do Ministério da Saúde. No documento, o Ministério da Saúde afirmou que ""os casos e óbitos da publicação de hoje podem não refletir o acumulado de eventos pendentes desde a paralisação dos sistemas de informações oficiais no dia 05/11/20"".
