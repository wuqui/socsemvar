If you're commuting in to London every day, want the experience of living in the city and want to build a social life there then it's pointless paying train fare and rent in the suburbs, you might as well just get a house share in London.

I use that line so I should also warn you it is notoriously bad especially in winter. Constant delays &amp; cancellations, expensive fares, overcrowding &amp; replacement buses pretty much every weekend. This is pre COVID obviously.

I think you're going to have to embrace house sharing, it's far from ideal sharing with strangers but it's the done thing in London.

The job market in DE pretty much stinks unless you want to work in downtown Wilmington or find work in retail or the State. I am not saying you can't find a job, it is just that the opportunities aren't as plentiful as they are in larger cities. As for the State jobs. I am a State worker and it actually took me several years to finally get in and I have a Bachelor's degree. The State tends to do a lot of inside hiring at first for positions, but once you are in you are in and if you have a degree in an area such as a business, IT, education or healthcare then you can change positions pretty easily as long as you meet your ""time in grade/position"" first. The lower level jobs that do not require degrees are much easier to get into. Covid might play a role in hiring  especially since the state is having a hard time with funds right now.

WaPo...Plasma from recovered patients could help treat covid-19 until we find a vaccine
Doctors in China tried it. We need to push for clinical trials here ‚Äî now.


https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/07/plasma-recovered-patients-could-help-treat-covid-19-until-we-find-vaccine/

‚ÄúBlood from people who recover from coronavirus could provide a treatment,‚Äù reported the Washington Post on March 27, just a couple weeks after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic.

Just over a week later, the Washington Post reported again that while there was no vaccine yet for COVID-19, ‚Äúwe do have one potentially promising treatment to help people infected with the coronavirus: infusions of antibody-rich plasma from other patients who have had the disease and recovered.‚Äù

A couple months later, the Washington Post again touted the potential of blood plasma, also called convalescent plasma, in treating the virus. ‚ÄúA large study of 20,000 hospitalized covid-19 patients who received transfusions of blood plasma from people who recovered found the treatment was safe and suggests giving it to people early in the disease may be beneficial,‚Äù they reported June 18, 2020, in an article headlined, ‚ÄúBlood plasma from people who recovered is a safe covid-19 treatment, study says.‚Äù

Earlier this month, four former FDA commissioners wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post arguing that ‚Äúblood plasma might be the COVID-19 treatment we need.‚Äù

Flash forward Trump‚Äôs announcement that a breakthrough treatment for the coronavirus, convalescent plasma, had been given emergency approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). According to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, plasma treatments reduce mortality of COVID-19 by 35 percent, but, suddenly, the Washington Post isn‚Äôt very impressed by blood plasma as a COVID-19 treatment anymore.

‚ÄúScientists express doubts about coronavirus treatment touted as breakthrough by Trump‚Äù reads the headline on their live updates page Monday afternoon.

The left just creates a narrative out of whole cloth for one simple reason.

If Trump supports it, they have to oppose it.

[http://fredwasmer.com/blog-post-table-for-two.htm](http://fredwasmer.com/blog-post-table-for-two.htm)

Here's the executive summary:

I've titled this photo ""Table for Two - An Ode to Social Distancing"". It was taken before dawn on May 31, 2020, near Gainesville, Florida.

It was made during the COVID-19 pandemic. I wanted to create an image commemorating the pandemic, and in particular the idea of social distancing. The idea was a surreal photo of formal dining in a remote meadow under a sweeping night sky. It would be an ode to **extreme** social distancing, both in space and time. The concept, and the title of the photo, was inspired by the ""Table for One"" pandemic-era restaurant in Sweden. 

This photo is a composite of separate exposures for the ground (including people) and the sky, as well shots of some light painting of the tree and grass. All shots were taken on a stationary tripod with same field of view, varying only the focus distance and exposure settings.

Equipment: Nikon D850 camera and Nikon 14-24mm f/2.8 lens at 22mm. Shot of sky: 30 seconds at f/2.8, ISO 800. Shot of ground and table: 1/20 second at f/4.8, ISO 560.

This spot is a 15-minute hike from the nearest road, so all gear was backpacked in. The models are my wife and I. The chairs are light-weight folding chairs; the table is a prop made from foamboard.

I forget the foundational issue but it turned into a bunch of really misinformed conjecture that was actually dangerous to spread so I commented something about why we should avoid feeding certain foods to dogs (like grain free diets) and whilst really struggling to type out a 3rd reply  just say there and realized I did not have enough time to actually finish the comment and by that I mean that I had to get to the Uber my friend ordered and that I literally did not have time enough to find the resources I needed to convince the echo group that what they were doing could legitimately harm their animal. Had I had enough time I think I could have easily stopped at least some of the people in the thread from possibly harming their beloved pets, but at that point, isn‚Äôt that what Vets are supposed to be getting paid for?

I sat in the Uber not saying a word and just looping on how bleak the whole information dissemination dogma is and how at least I couldn‚Äôt think of a way to fix it. 


I went back to the thread and creeped on some of the profiles and actually found two people who I thought were the originators of some really bad information. I‚Äôm only 26 but they were both kids, they had kids too but they were kids with kids and it looked liked their parents basically just parented their grandkids.

""*The American Board of Pathology (ABPath) is pleased to announce the certification requirement for autopsies is now* ***30 cases****,  effective immediately. This change is an interim adjustment until the  ABPath autopsy requirement can become competency-based with the use of  Entrustable Professional Activities (EPAs). The ABPath recognizes that  the pathology training curriculum has significantly expanded to include  such areas as molecular pathology, informatics, and laboratory  management, and therefore reducing the numerical requirement is a  reasonable adjustment. The ABPath also recognized that the COVID-19  pandemic has affected the number of autopsy cases in some training  programs and this adjustment will help those programs.*

*Using  data from a survey of Pathology Residency Program Directors, ABPath  determined that 30 cases is a reasonable number for most residents to  achieve competence in autopsy performance. The ABPath would like to  emphasize that 30 cases is the minimum numerical requirement and that  some residents may require more cases to achieve competency. Also,  teaching and service obligations may require residents to perform more  than 30 cases.*

*The  ABPath would like to emphasize that the following current requirements  for reporting an autopsy (including shared and medical legal cases)  remain unchanged. The applicant must have actively participated in all  the following:*

1. *review of the clinical history and circumstances of death*
2. *external examination of the body*
3. *gross dissection, including organ evisceration*
4. *review of the microscopic (as appropriate to the case) and laboratory findings*
5. *preparation of a written description of gross and microscopic findings*
6. *development of an opinion as to the cause of death*
7. *clinical-pathologic correlation*
8. *review of the autopsy report with a faculty member.*

*The ABPath policy on fetal autopsies remains unchanged.*

*The ABPath policy on shared autopsies:*

*There is no limit on the number of shared autopsies; no more than two residents can share an autopsy.*

***Effective July 2021:***

¬†*-Some  shared autopsies should be conducted by a more experienced resident  working with a less experienced resident to promote graduated  responsibility.*

***Effective July 2022:***

*-The  maximum number of limited autopsies (e.g. chest or abdomen only)  allowed is five, including single organ autopsies (e.g. brain only,  heart only), and cannot be shared.*

*-The program director will attest in the resident‚Äôs final evaluation that they are competent in the performance of autopsies.*

[],,SarahJFroxy,,,[],,,,text,t2_3l2e39z,False,False,[],"I had a really good teacher last year, but I also had prior experience from WHAP (before the change) so I had more preparation than you, but I think the following advice still applies:

The Test (Total 3 hours and 15 minutes, one break):

1. Multiple Choice (55 questions, 55 minutes): Don't spend too long on mc. Don't. You won't finish, so what I always do (i can read pretty quickly and comprehensively) is push through all the questions (most have a passage from history or a image + a set of \~3 questions) and do the best you can on the first swipe. By doing this, you lay out the groundwork assuming you speed read and still understand the questions, and you can use the leftover time to go back to any that you didn't understand. This isn't a popular method, but it works for me, maybe you could try it? 
2. Short Answer Questions (3 questions, multiple parts per q, 40 minutes): Honestly this is just about knowing your content and the essentials of it. Don't fluff it up to sound nice, name drop every single thing you remember that is relevant to answering the question. If it can be tied to it, put it down. Get your basics down that would get you the points, then move to expanding the worldview of your answer.

That is 1/2 of the test. I can't remember how long the break is, somewhere between 5-10 minutes where you can eat (if your school/teacher lets you bring snacks) or use the bathroom. Technically not supposed to talk about previous sections of the test with others, but I mean really, you can't change any answers since they collect that scantron and papers needed for the 1st half.

3. The DBQ &amp; LEQ (Total Time: 100 minutes): These get grouped together because they are given as one set of time, you can work on either part during this time and finish one then start the other, or jump to another in the middle of one if you want. You have total control over what you work on during this time. 

I didn't have to take the full test this year, but APUSH this year was entirely DBQ based. I did however take WHAP, so I know the stress of balancing DBQ &amp; LEQ. I focused nearly all my time on the DBQ and wrote like 3 paragraphs for the LEQ and got a 4, so its not a big deal if you don't finish the long essay because it's 15% of your score, so as long as you can do the other sections well, you're fine.

Now, what is a DBQ? --&gt; Document Based Question.

They will give you 7 charts (statistics, imports/exports, etc), images (paintings, etc.), and you will have to answer a question that spans a period of time. Usually this period of time is pretty coherent and stays within 1-2 units, but this year it was about largely overarching themes like slavery, manifest destiny, etc that transcended individual periods. You NEED a printed copy of an official DBQ grading sheet (available on the CB website if you do a little digging) because it tells you just what readers want from you. Many people this year failed because their teacher never taught them how to write a DBQ, or if they did, they taught them the old way or the way they wanted it done, but writing a DBQ is like processing a formula, methodical and step by step is best. If you get stuck, re-examine the docs, and see if you can make something up that could help you. I'm not kidding. As long as it's not historically wrong, you could argue anything if it supported your answer. Use the docs to support or reject ANYTHING. If there's a doc arguing against your position, then use it to support it. Twist the doc into what you need.

What is a LEQ? --&gt; The closest you can get to purgatory.

This is my absolute least favorite part of the tests. It's basically a DBQ but without documents to rely on to jog your memory or help you make stuff up. You're given a few questions you get to choose from, but your choices are pretty much all trying to kill you. The LEQ uses multiple questions, with each specifically asking for evidence from years \_\_\_\_ to \_\_\_\_\_, but the split is pretty much: Q1: units 1-3, Q2: 4-6, Q3:7-9. It is a very long time period, with a lot going on no matter what you do. I personally struggle to focus in on specific things since there is so much happening in each set, but my best advice is to pick a question that has your best time periods in it because at least then you can use context and pick out your favorite/most important events.

&amp;#x200B;

Welp. That was the test. But you don't need to worry about that for a while. My teacher waited until mid-April for us to start officially reviewing, but there was also COVID so you already know stuff went wrong, so your teacher will likely start earlier.

For in-class: Pay attention to any videos or images your teacher shows you. The test is image and text reliant, so you will almost definitely see something your teacher talked about in the test. 

Notes

Notes

NOTES

You can't ever use notes during any AP test. Ever. Unless they go online again this year, you will not be able to rely on notes. But taking notes makes reviewing easier, but APUSH is really long, so don't focus on small details, go for the major themes and events that make APUSH APUSH. You may think it's ok if you don't understand the industrial revolution, but you are wrong, my friend. It's ok to go to tutoring or look up a video on the internet, outside eyes are your best friend. 

Don't get discouraged if you struggle, people who've taken 4+ AP tests still struggle with APUSH a lot of the time.

 I guarantee there will be others in the same boat as you every step of the way, so sit back and have fun with the freedom AP teachers give you. Don't worry about if you don't have an A, some teachers are just stricter with grading, so you'll be fine by the end of the semester. If your parents get on your back, tell them to look at your other classes and evaluate your mental health. If they're stressing you out more than your classes and you are happy with your grade knowing you're trying, let them know. Sometimes they don't realize they are being worse than school. If worst comes to worst, ask your teacher to write them an email advocating on your behalf, they may respect another authority figure in your life.

Sorry this was so long, but this is important stuff to know in my opinion. Good luck, have fun!",,2020-08-28 07:17:51,{},g342abz,False,t3_ihz9fn,False,True,t3_ihz9fn,/r/APUSH/comments/ihz9fn/advice_for_taking_apush/g342abz/,1598599199.0,1,True,False,APUSH,t5_2swvs,,0.0,[],1598591871.0,,,

The bank bailout was also a balance sheet trick more than anything. We imposed a bunch of new rules to make them more solvent in the future (which is a big reason they didn't buckle under this bullshit)... but exactly one could actually operate (US Bank, who ended up merging in a bunch of shitty banks and went to hell). Ended up not actually costing much if anything (depends on how you calculate it, time costs are real and often ignored)... but more importantly it didn't actually enter the normal money supply so it kept inflation effects minimal.

Now on this idea of freezing mortgage payments... they effectively did. You can take a 12 month forbearance on any federally involved mortgage (ie anything conforming, so almost all) you could push those payments to the end of the loan. Why not make it automatic? Because every pension system on earth (public and private) basically relies on the income from Americans paying their mortgages regularly and consistently. Even during the crash of 2007, it was still one of the safest bets on earth. A huge chunk of the stimulus funds for banks in the CARES act went to backstopping the forbearance expansion, because those mortgage backed securities still need to be paid or grandma and grandpa are going to be eating dog food if they're lucky.

OK, so if landlords don't have to pay mortgages for another ~6 months if they don't have paying renters, why are they evicting? Well, there are other costs that were not handled, mostly property taxes, utilities (if included), and upkeep.

As a tenant, you get terrible housing for exorbitant prices, poor quality and indifferent landlords who only want to suck the money out of you. Took 5 years to get a window replaced in my last place (bottom of velux window fell of - had to gaffa tape it), when it was fixed, I was on holiday, the landlord let them in, I was never notified and the first I knew they had been in my flat was when I got back. Helped themselves to my fridge and didnt even bother to wash up.

As a patron in pubs in resteraunts, generally the service can be poor.
I blame this on the service culture in the UK both not being professional, and not being treated as such either.
Working in a pub, or a restaurant isn't something most people take seriously, but I do value greatly those who do the job well, the rest are just there to fill in some time, don't value their themselves, or care much about how they do they job.

On my last visit, waited at the door of the bridge pub, waited, waited... staff inside saw us, generally went about their business, on the way finally to the door - stopped to chat to someones dog.

Another pub, my ex local, dude working there, generally not interested, everyone is his mate, swans around like hes just popped in to help out. It was bad enough in some places before covid, but the online-ordering has generally just made a poor service worse.

UK isnt a table service culture, and they arent adapting to it well, the staff dont like it, no one wants to do the job unless they have to, so they appear to resent being there, and are generally safe to do, say, and act how they want.

On saying that, there were some pubs I liked, and there would be staff I was always pleased to see.
