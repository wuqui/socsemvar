I know there are reasons people are anti-nuclear including cost, purportedly safety (if people were really concerned with safety they would support nuclear since it has proven to be extremely safe per TWh and the new designs are made to be even safer), and purportedly waste (nuclear waste is the lowest in volume to be managed, we can have arguments about repositories, but they really don't need to be that big or complicated).

No electric vehicles is NOT a conservative assumption as stated in the report.  It reduces the total electrical demand and shifts electricity demand away from the evening peak.

"" The analysis we present here is not a forecast, but rather an illustrative “limit scenario” that makes very conservative and severely constraining assumptions: » No electricity imports » No distributed energy resources » **No electric vehicles** » No energy arbitrage » No conventional reserve capacity » No technological breakthroughs » No geothermal or other technologies that will reduce the HVAC load of buildings » No demand side management » No energy efficiency or building automation technologies that reduce electricity use » No bundling of additional services » No subsidies or carbon taxes ""

Electric vehicles are a major portion of electrical demand in deeply decarbonized situations.  You are giving yourself an enormous charge demand relief by making this assumption. This charge demand peak is occurs twice, once after the commute to work, and another after arriving home.  This is currently suppressed to some degree due to COVID and remote work arrangements (maybe they are sustainable changes, and maybe they are not).

Your report doesn't address regulatory cost escalation.  Once any form of power reaches about 10% of total capacity it becomes much more stiffly regulated.

I was living in California in my first job after college, still in broke college mode, and taking public transportation to/from work. I got up on the morning of 09/11 and was walking to the bus stop. This guy was riding a bike in the street and shouted out that we were being attacked. I kind of shrugged figuring it was a typical kooky neighbor thing. It was quiet on the bus in, and I only realized something was wrong when I got to work. People were huddled around TV’s and laptops, and the conservative clique guys were all excited about America being in war. 🙄 I kind of wrote it off at first, but when the agency deputies started freaking out, it became more real, and even more so when news came of the second plane and the Pentagon crash. They sent everyone home right before the towers fell. The bus ride was the most surreal and alien experience. It felt like I had suddenly been dropped into another reality. We didn’t know the extent of the attacks, so we had to wonder if our city would be next. Everyone was silent as the grave with huge wide eyes on the bus looking at everyone with a question of “who are you and should I be afraid of you” in their eyes. 

It wasn’t until the weeks and months that followed, that it became clear we had passed a watershed moment - a point where we could divide life into a “BC/AD” kind of reckoning. Pre-09/11, you could roll up to the airport 15 minutes before your flight and have no issues. You could greet your guests at the gate or see them off up to the point they boarded the plane. You could bring your coffee, smoothie, or water bottle with you. Post 09/11, not so much. Understand, it wasn’t that most of the changes were impossible to meet. Just like wearing a mask is annoying but not a major ordeal. It was more that you never knew when they would drop new requirements on us without notice. I was traveling in another city when the shoe bomber got caught. My mom called to let me know liquids were banned, which I shrugged off until I arrived at security and had to choose between making my flight by tossing my perfume, and checking luggage and missing the flight (I picked the former but was royally pissed about it). 

The more worrisome thing though was the Big Brother shit. So more security, fine. No liquids, fine. Body scanners that can count the fat rolls on my belly and ass, ugh, but fine. Military style checkpoints and huge warnings about reporting “suspicious” (i.e., not white) persons? Not so cool. Surrender of individual privacy and acceptance that we could be under scrutiny at any point - whoa. It felt like they were implementing draconian measures beyond what was maybe called for due to knee jerk responses. Talk to anyone who vaguely looks Middle Eastern and travelled back then, who can tell you about the “fun” of being subjected to full body pat downs and scans at security and then AGAIN at the gate. (Sure, they said they were “randomly” picking people for enhanced screening, but I traveled a lot and am white &amp; never got the dreaded “XXXXX” on my boarding pass, but my black friends and coworkers rarely if ever got a pass that DIDN’T have it). 

I think we are still in the middle of the storm with Covid-19. In comparison to 09/11, I would say we’re barely past the second plane hitting or maybe are seeing the towers collapse. We can’t really know what’s going to happen when the dust settles because it’s still in some hypothetical future.

1. Seeing someone with a mask on (anywhere, but especially in a situation the observer deems safe) is a subconscious reminder that Covid has changed everyday life in a negative and depressing manner and the mask prevents the respite from having to focus on that fact.  Anger about it gives them some kind of control over that negative internal feeling.

2.  They lack the creativity and/or intelligence to extrapolate all the reasonable explanations someone could have for wearing the mask in the car alone.  If I exit a store in one plaza and drive across the road to another plaza to enter another store, I'm leaving the mask on.  If I'm delivering things to one location with people to other locations with people, then I'm going to leave it on.  If I'm driving Uber or Lyft or whatever, I'm leaving it on.  You're seeing someone for a three second snippet of their existence and judging them with zero factual information.
