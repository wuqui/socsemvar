The story is that [Prestige Ameritech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prestige_Ameritech), a Texas manufacturer of masks and respirators, contacted the Department of Health &amp; Human Services on January 22, one day after the US's first confirmed COVID-19 case:

&gt; Bowen’s medical supply company, Prestige Ameritech, could ramp up production to make an additional 1.7 million N95 masks a week. He viewed the shrinking domestic production of medical masks as a national security issue, though, and he wanted to give the federal government first dibs.

&gt; “We still have four like-new N95 manufacturing lines,” Bowen wrote that day in an email to top administrators in the Department of Health and Human Services. “Reactivating these machines would be very difficult and very expensive but could be achieved in a dire situation.”

&gt; But communications over several days with senior agency officials — including Robert Kad­lec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and emergency response — left Bowen with the clear impression that there was little immediate interest in his offer.

The HHS continued to fumble the ball, with the results that (a) Prestige Ameritech's mask production lines are *still* not operating at capacity even after 80k (!) American COVID-19 deaths, and (b) [the person who exposed this blunderplex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bright) has been demoted.

[Tyler Cowen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Cowen) also [blogged about this](https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/05/hhs-turned-down-a-big-opportunity-to-make-a-lot-of-masks-early.html), one installment of [his many posts highlighting how the US's regulatory state is failing](https://marginalrevolution.com/?s=our+regulatory+state+is+failing+us).",,2020-05-11 08:37:25,{},fq95gts,True,t3_ghjsp9,False,True,t3_ghjsp9,/r/Libertarian/comments/ghjsp9/big_government_is_not_the_solution_its_the/fq95gts/,1589186246,1.0,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,0.0,[],1589179045.0,,,,

1. Screening of airplane passengers from China with flu-like symptoms starting ASAP from January 30. Trump's travel ban did not apply to American residents retiring from China


2. Beginning to stockpile PPE in preparation for a possible pandemic. Also, contracting companies to ramp up supplies of PPE


3. Screening of passengers from Italy in March, after the covid-19 outbreak there. 


4. Task FEMA with organizing and running a coordinated covid-19 response across the nation. Instead of 50 states scrambling and competing with each other for supplies, FEMA could control a stockpile and send equipment out where it's needed 


5. In January Trump could have created a task force to prepare for a pandemic, with scientists and experts.

In Trump’s first year, however, Bowen grew newly disillusioned. During a week that the White House touted its “Buy American, Hire American” initiative, Bowen lost a military contract worth up to $1 million, to a supplier that would make many of the masks in Mexico, he said.

“Shame on the Department of Defense! One of these days the US military will need America’s manufacturers to help win another war or fight another pandemic — and they will not exist,” Bowen wrote on Aug. 17, 2017, to Maj. Gen. Jeffrey Clark, a senior official with the Pentagon’s Defense Health Agency.

Clark, who retired last year, did not respond to a message seeking comment.
Proposal to produce goes nowhere

For Bowen, the first signs of trouble came in mid-January. Online orders through his company’s website, typically totaling maybe $2,000 a year and accounting for only a fraction of his business, suddenly skyrocketed to almost $700,000 in a few days.
AD

On Jan. 20, Bowen also fielded a call from the Department of Homeland Security, urgently seeking masks for airport screeners. Bowen said he did not have masks in stock to fill the order, but the call led him to contact Bright to tell him about the surge in demand for masks. “Is this virus going to be problematic?” Bowen wrote.

Inside HHS, Bright quickly passed Bowen’s on-the-ground observations to a group that included Wolf, the director of the agency’s Division of Critical Infrastructure Protection.

“Can you please reach out to Mike Bowen below? He is a great partner and a really good source for helpful information,” Bright wrote on Jan. 21.

“Thanks Rick,” she replied. “We are tracking and have begun to coordinate with fda, niosh, and manufacturers today. More to follow tomorrow. Thinking about masks, gowns (inc those in shortage), gloves, and eye protection.”

Within a day, Bowen sent an email to Wolf laying out what Prestige could do. The company’s four mothballed manufacturing lines could be restarted with large noncancelable orders, he wrote.

“This is NOT something we would ever wish to do and have NO plans to do it on our own,” he wrote. “I’m simply letting you know that in a dire situation, it could be done.”

Over the next three days, Bowen kept HHS officials informed as orders for a million masks came in from intermediaries for buyers in China and Hong Kong. On Jan. 26, he sent the email warning that the U.S. mask supply was at “imminent risk.”

Bright forwarded it that day to Kadlec and others, urging action: “We have been watching and receiving warnings on this for over a week,” he wrote.

The next day, Bright wrote to his deputy asking him to explore whether BARDA could divert money earmarked for vaccines and other biodefense measures to instead buy masks.

From his end, Bowen said his proposal seemed to be going nowhere. “No one at HHS ever did get back to me in a substantive way,” Bowen said.

The senior U.S. official said Bowen’s idea was considered, but funding could not easily be obtained without diverting it from other projects.

Bowen started talking to reporters about the mask shortage in general terms. He was soon invited to appear on former Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon’s podcast: “War Room: Pandemic.”

On the Feb. 12 podcast, the two commiserated over the beleaguered state of U.S. manufacturing. “What I’ve been saying since 2007 is, ‘Guys, I’m warning you, here’s what is going to happen, let’s prepare,’ ” Bowen said on the program. “Because if you call me after it starts, I can’t help everybody.”

Bowen said Bannon put him in touch with Navarro, the White House economic adviser.

Navarro was quick to see the problem, Bowen said. After talking with Navarro, Bowen wrote to Bright that he should soon expect a call from the White House, “I’m pretty sure that my mask supply message will be heard by President Trump this week,” Bowen wrote. “Trump insider reading yesterday’s Wired.com article, the ball is screaming toward your court.”

According to Bright’s complaint, he soon began attending White House meetings and helping Navarro write memos describing the supply of masks as a top issue. Emails and memos attached to the complaint show Bright reporting back to Kadlec and others about his work with Navarro.

None of it turned the tide for Bowen.

Nearly a month after his emailed offer, Bowen received his first formal communication about possibly helping to bolster the U.S. supply. The five-page form letter from the Food and Drug Administration — one Bowen said he suspected was sent to many manufacturers — asked how his company could help with what was by then a “national emergency response” to the shortage of protective gear.

Bowen responded on Feb. 16, by firing off a terse email to FDA and HHS officials. He directed the agencies to a U.S. government website listing approved foreign manufacturers of medical masks. “There you’ll find a long list of . . . approved Chinese respirator companies,” he wrote. “Please send your long list of questions to them.”

In March, Bowen submitted a bid to supply masks to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which by then had taken over purchasing.

The government soon spent over $600 million on contracts involving masks. Big companies like Honeywell and 3M were each awarded contracts totaling for over $170 million for protective gear. One distributor of tactical gear — a company with no history of procuring medical equipment — was awarded a $55 million deal to provide masks for as much as $5.50 a piece, eight times what the government was paying months earlier.

On April 7, FEMA awarded Prestige a $9.5 million contract to provide a million N95 masks a month for one year, an order the company could fulfill without activating its dormant manufacturing lines. For the masks, Prestige charged the government 79 cents a piece.

Jon Swaine, Robert O’Harrow Jr. and Rachel Siegel contributed to this report.

Before pandemic, Trump’s stockpile chief put focus on biodefense. An old client benefited.

[],,BlueGold,,,[],,,,text,t2_4wtiv,False,False,[],"I think you're right, and I also think that with respect to this:

&gt;I just don’t believe that those numbers are very accurate

the same can be said about confirmed cases, and the number of confirmed cases vs. the number of *actual* cases is likely profoundly larger than the difference between confirmed covid-related deaths vs. *actual* covid-related deaths. Thus, these current mortality rates we have to work with (i.e. NY 7.8%, Mass 6.5%) are actually significantly lower. It's also very likely, given the dismal testing regimen in most US states, that even with the underreporting of covid-related deaths in most (very likely all) states, those mortality rates in FL, GA and Texas are actually significantly lower than the figures we currently have (i.e. 4.2%, 4.3%, and 2.8%), as well. 

None of that is to say you're not spot on. I think you are. It just seems the current mortality rates are grossly unreliable metrics for us to be comparing and contrasting, given the profound lack of sufficient testing, and the *actual* number of covid-positive cases throughout the U.S. very likely being an order of magnitude larger than what we currently think (which is about 1.47 million). Again, while the total of confirmed covid-related deaths is definitely lower than it is in reality, it wouldn't surprise me if the number of covid-positive cases were 10x higher, or even more than that... 

I also am curious about this: 

&gt;there is no possible way that states with more distant hospitals and small rural health clinics are managing a lower mortality rate than the states that have a hospital nearly every 10-15 miles.

Oregon is currently 41st in total confirmed cases by state (3,358), and 37th in deaths (130), and while the *actual* number of covid-positive cases is likely significantly higher, I don't know if the number of *actual* covid-related deaths could be described as ""significantly"" higher. I'd wager it's definitely above what's reported, but probably not by much. I'm in OR, and have a farm in a very rural county, and split my time between there and Portland, and hospitals throughout the state are well below capacity and have not experienced any semblance of a ""surge"" or slam on the healthcare system. My bro and sister-in-law are both MDs pulling shifts at major hospitals and working with rural clinics, and they're testing everyone who dies on-site, whether it's from a gunshot or respiratory ailments. My dad tested positive back in early March too, luckily his fever and cough abated within a few days, but he's been tested again since. 

So, when it comes to this: ""no possible way that states with more distant hospitals and small rural health clinics are managing a lower mortality rate,"" I'm not sure that's accurate. There are lots of elements to consider regarding transmission rates and why they'd be lower in states out West, not to mention the effect of going into lockdown earlier than most states back East did. Oregon also has a smaller population and smaller population density than all the examples you gave (FL, TX, GA, NC) and, to me, it actually makes pretty good sense why NY, Mass, and CT would have higher mortality rates than we do...

There are also very few documented cases of transmission from outdoor recreation, based on contact tracing.   

""But what little we know about the coronavirus suggests you have little to fear from brief encounters with other human beings outside. Dr. Edward Nardell, an airborne-infection specialist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said outdoor transmission was “possible but improbable.”

“It bugs me to see these restrictions on people being outside,” Nardell said. “Mental health means something as well, and I can’t imagine you’re in a better place than outside if you’re going to have any contact anywhere.” Nardell, who survived a recent battle with COVID-19, said that if he were in Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker’s shoes, he would go ahead with opening the state’s beaches—but with strong signage reminding people to keep their distance and under park ranger supervision.

Nardell’s colleague Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist, wrote a more general case for public spaces in the Washington Post last week.* “Closing parks and public gardens should be a temporary, last-resort measure for disease control,” he and his co-authors wrote. “The science could not be clearer: The benefits of getting outside vastly outweigh the risk of getting infected in a park.” Wear a mask, keep your distance, have a ball.""

The elections have planned to be held simultaneously in 270 regions across the archipelago nation to elect 9 governors, 37 mayors and 224 district chiefs, with the number of eligible voters reached at least 105 million.
The regulation was issued following the country's General Election Commission decision to postpone its preparation stages of the regional elections at the end of March after revealing that election organizers have also caught the COVID-19 disease and stakeholders moved to delay the polls.
Postponing this year's regional elections was the most viable option to avoid COVID-19 from further spreading to rural areas, the election authority has said earlier.

On the other hand, assuming that everyone around the world is at equal risk of infection during this pandemic and that everyone has an equal chance of death (which we know for certain is not the case i.e. senior citizens, diabetics, asthmatics, hiv, etc.), the percent of those at risk of infection that have died is about 0.004%

A new study published April 22 in the Journal of the American Medical Association characterizes the symptoms, comorbidities, and clinical outcomes of 5,700 patients hospitalized because of COVID-19 in the New York area. The authors found that 94 percent of the patients had a chronic health problem, and 88 percent had two or more. The three most prevalent conditions were hypertension (56.6 percent), obesity (41.7 percent), and diabetes (33.8 percent).

The findings were observational of patients with severe illness and the health conditions correlated with these patients do not necessarily apply to all COVID-19 cases or represent causation. 

“We’re simply describing the patients who came in and required hospitalization,” senior author Karina Davidson, a senior vice president at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, tells The New York Times. “We are not comparing them to those who were positive and stayed out of the hospital, or who didn’t get infected, or to patients with any other disease.”

A total of 1,151 patients were put on ventilators during their hospitalization. Of those, 831 remained intubated at the end of the study, 282 patients died, and 38 were discharged. None of the patients under 20 years old died, and men died at a higher rate than women. Forty-five patients were re-admitted after being discharged from the hospital after an average of three days at home.

“Is there any pattern of symptoms that predicts a worse outcome or predicts people are in fact going to be safe and can be managed at home?” Davidson tells NBC News. “We think that’s the burning question.” Davidson also reminded NBC News that ""in 1998, The Undertaker threw Mankind off Hell In A Cell, and plummeted 16 ft through an announcer's table.""",,2020-05-15 00:51:32,{},fqnyfyp,False,t3_gjwoyv,False,True,t3_gjwoyv,/r/conspiracy/comments/gjwoyv/several_studies_have_shown_that_people_with_low/fqnyfyp/,1589511998,1.0,True,False,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,0.0,[],1589496692.0,,,,

Pertussis , rubella, and polio are all in the 5-7 range. And it is well less than some of the super contagious diseases like chickenpox and mumps (10-12) and especially measles (12-18)

As for disease eradication, the disease humanity is arguably closest to eradicating is polio, which has been limited to a handful of cases in 3-4 countries a year. Unfortunately the measures taken to control covid19 have slowed vaccination efforts in these places.

http://theinfectiousmyth.com/coronavirus/AntibodyTestingForCOVID.pdf

Excerpts:

&gt;""Antibody tests are often subject to cross-reactions with other conditions. This could be because the [other irrelevant] medical condition produces similar antibodies, or because something related to that [other] condition reacts with other test components.  The choice of [cross-reacting] conditions to check for is completely under the control of the manufacturer and even when no cross reactions were found for a condition, the number of samples tested was so small that the possibility of a fairly high rate of false positive cross reactions still exists.""

&gt;""Positive antibody tests have only been found in a minority of people in the general population even where the virus is believed to have been circulating for months. These fractions are generally taken as truth, but one would expect a highly infectious virus to have spread much more widely...The one experiment that could show whether antibody tests are actually meaningful would be a time series of a large number of people who are currently negative on all tests. This experiment would be time consuming, inefficient (as many people would never become positive on any tests), intrusive (frequent nasal swabs and blood tests) and obviously very expensive. Those are practical considerations, but in the absence of such an experiment we are almost totally in the dark about COVID-19 antibody testing. Given the billions being spent on COVID and the trillions being lost by the economy, it surely is not impossible to do some worthwhile science.""",,2020-05-15 19:01:32,{},fqqoucp,False,t3_gk9h2q,False,True,t1_fqpq0we,/r/conspiracy/comments/gk9h2q/does_the_virus_exist_or_is_it_a_hoax/fqqoucp/,1589572485,1.0,True,False,conspiracy,t5_2qh4r,0.0,[],1589562092.0,,,,

You need to get into contact of someone already infected to catch but considering you are not going outside, you can't catch it. Think about all the symptoms, fever is not a symptom of COVID,( even a seasonal flu can give you high fever) you need to have cough along with it. Now I will remind you that the coughing will be dry and it will be bad, bad enough to cause you breathing difficulty. But what you have mentioned you haven't experienced any coughing, so obviously you don't have any virus. 

Think about all these facts in your mind and tell yourself about them. Not like actually tell them to yourself but tell them like as if you are giving advice to someone else or telling about them to someone else. When you will think in a way of giving advice to someone else your emotions will not get involved and automatically you will feel less anxious or worried when going through the facts. Your mind will start make sense of the the facts and you will feel relaxed. ( This method has worked really well for me).

Lastly, I will say juts get yourself into some work, any activity that will use thinking skills. When you get involved in work that uses your mind your anxiety will start to get significantly less. The actual reason why we get anxiety is because when our mind is blank( obviously during this time most people are at home and doing nothing productive), it is the nature of our mind to fill our mind with the most ridiculous ideas and worries which lead us to Anxiety. So don't sit around, go start doing some productive work that requires your to think and use your mind.

De plus, tu dis que la CJUE est seule à décider pour l'UE : ce que ne conteste pas la cour allemande puisqu'elle examine uniquement la participation allemande qui implique notamment la Bundesbank.

La cour allemande ne peut pas ne rien dire alors que selon elle, il y a une atteinte anticonstitutionnelle.

Elle n'entend pas dire ce que l'UE, la BCE ou la banque nationale polonaise doivent faire : non, elle examine seulement l'aspect allemand de la question.",,2020-05-12 12:59:26,{},fqdf9uj,False,t3_ghk9nn,False,True,t1_fqdcldc,/r/france/comments/ghk9nn/bce_bruxelles_envisage_de_sanctionner_lallemagne/fqdf9uj/,1589288368,1.0,True,False,france,t5_2qhjz,0.0,[],1589281166.0,,,,
