I gave you the science &amp; plenty of links backing my statements to help you understand that there are many types of people in the world that may look &amp; act different than you &amp; thats ok. You dont need to invalidate them because you dont understand them. What are my ridiculous assertions?

That they deserve to not be ridiculed by hate spewing folks like you? Why are you trying so hard to deny these people basic humanity of acknowledging their existence? I really dont understand what your issue is with gender/sex terminology or trans people. Why do you take issue with this?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Is, yet again, another example of you ignoring the majority of evidence in favor of an outlier that you believe makes your case.

I really sincerely appreciate that you did have good sources. You are missing that a 65,000 person study is incredibly statistically valid. Look at the methods &amp; sample sizes in your studies. Look at the safety &amp; prevention methods used to keep people safe in public &amp; at school in your mentioned studies (in addition to their public healthcare, meaning people go to the doctor faster when symptoms arise because there isn't the medical debt burden threat) vs if America is following those same protocols (we aren't). Those countries aren't the centers of the pandemic either, America is. If the feds or even state government got serious about safety protocols at school, it would be a different story, but right now it's an unorganized free-for-all. Each one of those 'low statistics' you callously point to is a dead child. Many who didn't die will have serious lung &amp; heart complications that very well may be life long, so pointing to just deaths is overlooking the wider health crisis. Again, your posts are full of hubris. You dont know what you dont know. America still isn't out of our first wave, yet as we've learned from the [Flu Pandemic of 1918](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pandemic-resources/1918-commemoration/three-waves.htm), the second wave is usually more deadly. Here you are ready to march headstrong into that second wave no matter how many kids die. 

I say they need to teach remotely until there is a coherent plan for safety. My high school at the time didn't have enough books or desks for all the students, so we had to rotate. No way in hell that school will have proper safety protocols without significant additional support

&gt; No one should be making more on unemployment than they were while working

Hey, we agree one something! If someone needs more on unemployment to survive than they were making working, then I believe we have a problem with wages.

&gt; they should get nothing if they arebt actively trying to get work or declining to go back to work

And we disagree here. I would personally have as little people working as necessary right now, (obviously there are still jobs that have to be done). And that is not just an opinion based on my political beliefs, philosophical beliefs, or even my feelings. It's backed by pretty much any credible medical professional. 

If we could actually get the spread under control, open things slowly in a sensible way, with widespread testing and contact tracing, we could be back to normal much sooner. In fact, had we done that back in March, we may have been back to semi-normal by now. Once again, this is not just my opinion. Look at pretty much every other developed nation in the world and where they are at compared to the US.

&gt; It also means that maybe they are uneducated and not qualified for a better paying job, or maybe they just made poor choices earlier in life.

Let's assume everybody in the US made great choices early in life, they all got a college degree, and now they are looking for high paying hourly/salaried positions. What happens to the economy? Well, it's fucked. Who bags groceries, mans the cash register, prepares your meals in a restaurant/fast food, works at meat packing plants, boxes your Amazon orders? All of these positions are needed to drive our economy forward, and these are tens of millions of positions, so it's not an insignificant number of people. There are nowhere near enough high-paying jobs to support every one of these people, nor could our economy support having no low-skilled positions. And if we had enough high-paying jobs to support all of these workers, it would dilute the market for those positions, driving the wages down. We end up in an entirely similar position.

And by your logic, all of these tens of millions of Americans working entry-level are either A) Not trying hard enough or B) Making poor choices in life. I prefer to consider a third option C) that's the way the system is designed, (which is a fact - capitalism needs a hierarchy to work). Not to mention, points A and B are discounting the myriad of ways one might be held back in life, but this comment is already pretty long.

It’s why viruses are so successful in this world.**”

&gt;**Many vaccines against the coronavirus, as well as several treatments, take aim at its spike protein**, the virus’s most potent weapon — and its Achilles’ heel. Without its spikes, the pathogen can’t get into human cells.

&gt;Therapies based on this potent protein could stop infections in their tracks. Some promising vaccines, for example, prompt the body to make spike-specific antibodies that might vanquish the virus. And many companies in the race to find coronavirus treatments are making synthetic versions of these molecules, called monoclonal antibodies, to mimic this process en masse.

&gt;But all viruses are moving targets. When they replicate, their genetic material doesn’t copy itself perfectly, and mistakes are common. Although most of these mutations are inconsequential, they occasionally lead to noticeable changes in the viruses’ appearance — some of which may disguise them from the immune system. Cavalries of antibodies trained to recognize one version of spike might be totally discombobulated by another, leaving the person vulnerable to disease.

That's exactly why Sorensen and his team are making Biovacc-19 and they focus on the conserved regions that are also the least likely to trigger autoimmune responses (which are a concern since the spike on the SARS-CoV-2 virus fit so well with the ACE2 receptor). Taken from their paper (peer-reviewed and accepted at QRB Discovery, part of Cambridge Publishing):

&gt;We were in the minority of vaccine designers with regard to Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV) vaccine development, having concluded that a vaccine based on the envelope gp120 would not be effective. We proposed instead using the unique gag proteins as the basis of the Vacc4x vaccine which has been shown to induce robust immune responses and reduce the HIV viral load in several multicentre studies (Pollard et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2018). It is thirty six years since the world was promised an HIV vaccine that would be ready in eighteen months. We correctly predicted the failure of all three major HIV/AIDS vaccines over those years, and specifically the danger of poor immune responses to conserved human-like domains and antibody- enhanced infectivity to high mutating domains. Earlier this year, the latest South African trial was terminated due to futility in preventing HIV transmission (UNAIDS, 2020). From our past HIV experience, we therefore observe that in the present context, **any vaccine design based on the whole Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 may not be immunogenic due its high human similarity compared to a vaccine with specifically selected NHL epitopes, such as Biovacc-19 does - and is**.

&gt;**Covid-19 candidate vaccines designed without appreciating these problems may run similar risks to those experienced with HIV vaccines that failed to show protection**. The possibility of inducing autoimmune responses or antibody-dependent enhancements, needs to be carefully guarded against because there is published evidence that an HIV candidate vaccine has actually enhanced infectivity (Duerr et al., 2012): ""Vaccinations were halted; participants were unblinded. In post hoc analyses, more HIV infections occurred in vaccinees vs placebo recipients in men who had Ad5-neutralizing antibodies and/or were uncircumcised. Follow-up was extended to assess relative risk of HIV acquisition in vaccinees vs placebo recipients over time”. Such antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) has been observed for coronaviruses in animal models, allowing them to enter cells expressing Fc𝛾R. ADE is not fully understood: however, it is suggested that antibody-dependent enhancements may come as a result of amino acid variability and antigenic drift (Ricke et al., 2020; Negro et al., 2020).",,2020-08-01 18:59:03,{},g00fefb,False,t3_i1ekw9,False,True,t3_i1ekw9,/r/Wuhan_Flu/comments/i1ekw9/the_coronavirus_could_dodge_some_treatments_study/g00fefb/,1596309765.0,1,True,False,Wuhan_Flu,t5_2dzhyr,,0.0,[],1596301143.0,,,

&gt;  
&gt;The [interlocal agreement](https://www.austintexas.gov/edims/document.cfm?id=343414) would approve up to $500,000 in funding toward consulting services with five groups, including Alvarez &amp; Marsal Public Sector Services’ work in planning and releasing a request for information from property owners and potential operators of facilities. Other consultants involved in the agreement are Arup Advisory Inc., Jones Lang LaSalle Americas Inc., P3 Point Corporation and PFM Financial Advisors LLC.  
&gt;  
&gt;The city is seeking outside help to broker potential partnerships, with a recent [city memo](http://www.austintexas.gov/edims/pio/document.cfm?id=344020) spelling out that the consultants’ expertise “will enable city staff to expeditiously and more seamlessly match interested sites and landowners with potential facility operators.”  
&gt;  
&gt;A May memo spelled out that stand-alone and mixed-use spaces would receive equal consideration for possible acquisition and specified some of the ownership and leasing scenarios the city could possibly enter into to meet the goal of creating spaces for local artists and musicians.  
&gt;  
&gt;The request for information is expected to go public by mid-August.  
&gt;  
&gt;Voters approved the bond proposal in 2018 as part of a larger package centered around improving city arts facilities and preserving creative spaces that are increasingly at risk of redevelopment or closure.  
&gt;  
&gt;A working group made up of members of the arts and music commissions delivered recommendations last year that suggested the city focus on existing facilities rather than building new ones, with East Austin seen as the most important region of the city for arts preservation efforts.  
&gt;  
&gt;Rick Carney, chair of the Music Commission, said he is glad to see the city moving forward with a process to deploy the bond money after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in the spring turned most of city staff attention elsewhere. He said having consultants with experience in structuring public-private partnerships will help the city find appropriate projects to support.  
&gt;  
&gt;“The idea is it could be one giant project, several small ones … it’s not set in stone with how it’s got to play out. Having someone in that process who is helping to nurture ideas is probably a good idea because there’s a lot of layers to how the recommendations were set up,” he said. “At this point it’s about finding the things that coalesce. If we can find compatible projects that will give this more mileage, I support what the city is thinking to have somebody come in to kind of connect the dots.”  
&gt;  
&gt;Dan Redman, founder of the Mosaic Sound Collective arts and music space in East Austin, said the pandemic has created even more need for arts organizations to stabilize their ownership and partnership situations. In public hearings regarding the bond money, Redman has emphasized the versatility of the 25,000-square-foot space that sits on 2.5 acres and is intended to eventually include affordable housing for local artists.  
&gt;  
&gt;“I’m open to anything and everything that helps move the ball forward, especially now since this has never been a money-making venture and it’s just trying to help the community and is more needed now than ever before,” he said. “What would be most important in my mind is what the actual output is and how many people a project really helps, rather than ‘Here’s an organization that needs money so let’s throw money at it.’ What is your community engagement? What is your youth engagement? How many people are you helping and how well will this money be spent?”",,2020-07-28 12:45:57,{},fzi9uzo,True,t3_hze0cu,False,True,t3_hze0cu,/r/Austin/comments/hze0cu/city_moving_forward_with_plans_for_12m_to_acquire/fzi9uzo/,1595951549.0,1,True,False,Austin,t5_2qhn5,,0.0,[],1595933157.0,,,

As the pandemic continues to people's affect lives alternate measure are being explored with alternate medicine as precaution against the virus. Karnataka Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, K S Eswarappa, has pledged to help the citizens of Shivamogga in every possible manner during this unprecedented times.
As part of this commitment, K S Eswarappa, will be distributing free-of-cost immunity enhancer Auyrvedic medicine kits to approximately 85,000 families in Shivamogga.
In addition to all the measures undertaken by the district administration to contain the spread of COVID-19,  K S Eswarappa is certain that this medicine kit will help more than four lakh residents of Shivamogga City to boost their immunity and thereby help in combating the severity of illness caused by this deadly virus.
Enhancing the body’s natural defense system (immunity) plays an important role in maintaining optimum health and we all know that prevention is better than cure. As there is no vaccine for COVID-19, K S Eswarappa believes it is vital for the residents to take this preventive measure and boost their immunity during these times.
The Ayurvedic medicine kit, prescribed by the Ayush Department, consists of Shamshamani vati tablets, Ayush Kwath powder and Arsenicum Album tablets. Samshamani Vati, an ayurvedic medicine, is formulated to treat the all types of fevers. It has antipyretic and anti-inflammatory properties.
Giloya (Indian Tinospora) is used to prepare this Ayurvedic medicine. It balances Vata and Pitta dohsas in the body. Ayush Kwath, another Ayurvedic medicine, is a potent Ayurvedic formulation that increases natural immunity and protects against common health problems.
This is prepared from the best quality Tulsi (basil), Saunth (dried ginger), Kali Mirch (black pepper) and Dalchini (cinnamon). Ayush Kwath also improves respiratory health and boosts digestion. Arsenicum Album is a homeopathic medicine to enhance immunity.
