Our President saw Covid as something that might hurt his one claim to fame: a strong economy.  His entire strategy was to ride the good economy to a reelection.  When Covid came, however, there was concern that it would hurt the economy and thus his chances of reelection.  So, he downplayed it and downplayed it and downplayed it.  He wanted people to keep shopping, going to work, buying, selling etc. so the economy would remain strong and he could get reelected.  

It was terribly shortsighted as ignoring and downplaying the problem only made it (and the effect on the economy) worse.

He made a point about not wearing a mask and made fun of his opponent for wearing a mask. He held rallies where no one was asked to social distance or wear a mask.  He supported the narrative that hospitals were over-diagnosing Covid to get more money and supported stories that all the excess deaths we were seeing (as compared to prior years) were not from Covid.  He told Americans that it was not any worse than the flu and made it clear his position that it was nothing more than a plot to overthrow him. . .fake news.

**Pre-covid,** it is a busy, loud area, as 9th Avenue is filled with restaurants and bars that attract the post-work happy hour and pre/post-theater crowd. It's typically attracts a lot of gay men, since there are a few gay bars in the area. Note that 9th Avenue is a feeder into the Lincoln Tunnel, so it does get a fair amount of traffic in the evening rush hour. The closer you get to Port Authority on 42nd Street, the grosser it gets. It's pretty safe at night, especially since there's always bars and restaurants open. At 52nd, you're very close to the C/E 50th stop (less than 5 minutes), and a 10-15 minute walk to the very busy Times Square/50th - Broadway stations.

**During covid,** it is much, much emptier and as a result, you will see a lot more of the seedier crowd. There are halfway homes in Hell's Kitchen, and it still attracts plenty of drug dealers and prostitutes, but that's definitely in the lower 40s. Above 52nd Street, it's pretty damned nice.

In any case, the messaging around AIDS is quite different than that around Covid-19. 

First of all, it is much slower disease, both in how fast it spreads, and how fast it kills. It can take up to a decade before HIV turns into AIDS and kills you, even without any treatment.

Secondly, AIDS had a massive social stigma associated with it. It was initially known as GRID (gay related Immunodeficiency syndrome), and it's spread was associated with drug use. So, AIDS was characterized as a disease of those with low socio-economic status and deviant behaviour. Proper people did not get aids.

This meant that AIDS was in fact largely ignored initially. The Reagan administration largely ignored AIDS. Although the disease was identified in 1981, Reagan would not comment on it till 1985. His conservative policies and ideas clashed with effective AIDS prevention measures (for example, widespread advocacy of condoms).",,,2020-12-12 19:00:53,{},gfkgcvf,False,t3_kbs35s,False,False,t1_gfk5ueq,/r/changemyview/comments/kbs35s/cmv_joe_biden_and_kamala_harris_should_not_have/gfkgcvf/,1607803861,1,True,False,changemyview,t5_2w2s8,,0,[],1607792453.0,,

This is all I want. It doesn‚Äôt have to be a timeline, but a set of conditions that *do not change*.

For what it's worth, grey market cashing out got me \~75% of my money back, which is more than I believe I would have gotten in arbitration, but that's an untestable hypothesis, so whatever.

The other piece of that puzzle... and I mean this as nicely as possible... I was exhausted. Fighting CIG isn't an easy task... I did it because I thought it needed to be done... at the time, they hadn't clarified their refund policy, and I was one of the earlier ones (post  3.0) to get put in that mailbot que where they infinitely promise they'll eventually look at your case, but never do. I was also in a unique position, different than many backers, in that I had backed early enough that my original TOS, covering several transactions, clearly provided for a refund. Though you're not allowed lawyers in small claims court, and most of the cases are heard and adjudicated in 10-15 minutes... as soon as I saw CIG sidestepped the rules by submitting a brief from lawyers, though the lawyers wouldn't actually be appearing, I also went out and consulted with lawyers, got advice, and laid out my case more clearly.

I'm not a Californian either, so, again... I flew there and stayed in the hotel on my own dime/miles because I thought it was a fight worth fighting, and I don't like big companies simply flexing their size to fuck over customers. I fought my hardest for several months, including several hours there in court, I beat back their lies one by one, then ultimately, the judge decided to apply later TOS to earlier transactions, despite the first line of the TOS expressly saying that wouldn't happen. I'd lost. I mean, I know it was without prejudice and I had leave to refile... but at some point, you've gotta know when you've lost, process that, and consciously decide to file that as ""experience"" and start moving forward again, a little more beaten and weathered for the experience... but forward nonetheless

I did my best, but I lost.

The reality for me is I backed a 2 year project, mostly for SQ42... and it never came... my MS is at a point now where I don't really do shooters... I maybe might do a single player shooter if there's some cheats on [cheathappens.net](https://cheathappens.net) or whatever... but trying to do a shooter with tobii is awful (great for turn-based games though!)... and well, for SQ42... by the time it comes, if it ever comes, my hands are already past the point of being able to really do that... and they cut out multiplayer, so its not even like I could just be someone else's shitty medic and at least watch the story.

So... here's the dilly... sometimes the bad guys win. The thing we \*can\* do is level the playing field, somewhat by asking our local legislators to ban forced arbitration clauses and make reforms to laws regarding crowdfunding, but also, by stacking the deck and making sure that the good guys still win more than the bad guys.

To that end, here's some good guys who could really use some help right now:

TWR also takes foster kids on shopping trips before school years start, buys christmas presents for foster kids, and when COVID struck, helped foster kids in their first year of college, because they didn't have a ""home"" to go back to when so many colleges simply shut their doors and left foster kids homeless.

Yes, that‚Äôs why I said daily COVID numbers are a significant contribution to weekly cases (or a 7 day average, if you like), **which is in turn** a useful snapshot of a region‚Äôs success.

I know, sentence construction is hard (am I being snarky enough to participate in this thread?).
