Clearly, the opening question is being asked in a loaded way. 

I'm trained as a scientist, and I spend my days analyzing clinical data and keeping track of cancer drug approvals for education purposes. 

1) I have no problem with the FDA authorizing and distributing chloroquine on flimsy efficacy evidence. It is purely anecdotal, but we're dealing with an emergency, and there may be some benefit. I am furthermore fine with the move because...

2) The safety profile of these agents is very well known and very well documented. Therefore, this isn't really running a mass experiment that's putting a lot of people in harm's way. 

3) However, trumpeting the benefit of these drugs as ""possibly a miracle"" is irresponsible, at best. Dangerous at worst. The more authorities like Trump tout the promise of these drugs (which, again, are NOT PROVEN), the more patients demand them. The more patients demand them, the more doctors will prescribe. It's probably safe to say that few doctors in America have much, if any, experience prescribing chloroquine. Who should receive it? Who SHOULDN'T receive it? Your standard general practitioner enlisted to the front lines against COVID-19 could be forgiven for not knowing this well enough.

Therefore, even though the FDA has permitted this emergency authorization, we have to be careful. The president is not being careful with anything. He deserves this criticism for blasting out irresponsible nonsense about it being ""one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine"" if it works. 

But for your average person, who may be desperate for some kind of hope, the ""if it works"" part is parenthetical. The ""biggest game changer"" hype is what they'll hear. We have very little evidence that chloroquine is going to do anything, let alone change the game. It just speaks to the level of desperation we're at with COVID-19, that we have so few options that we're grasping at anything.",,2020-03-31 13:51:16,{},fm0o5ar,False,t3_fs49bm,False,True,t1_fm0moes,/r/AskTrumpSupporters/comments/fs49bm/thoughts_on_fda_approval_of_hydroxychloroquine/fm0o5ar/,1585662678,1,True,False,AskTrumpSupporters,t5_3cr3o,0,1585655476.0,,,

[],,Publix_Deli,,,[],,,,text,t2_s70ki,False,False,[],"&gt; So we should instead make it standard of care to dose everybody with an unproven drug treatment that has zero evidence of actually working?

As others have already said, there is not ""zero"" evidence. There is tentative evidence that it works, but it's not definitive because we haven't had enough time yet.

There are three factors to consider when deciding whether or not to administer a drug:

1) Likelihood that the patient will deteriorate or suffer if they receive no additional treatment.

It has been well-established that COVID-19 patients have an unacceptable likelihood of hospitalization and mortality. That's why were all stuck at home right now.

2) Likelihood that the patient will suffer adverse side-effects from the drug

HCQ is not an ""unproven"" drug. Its efficacy in treating COVID-19 is still only tentatively supported, but its side-effects are thoroughly understood and documented. It is an extremely low-risk drug to prescribe. It's even used by perfectly healthy people as a prophylactic for malaria.

3) Likelihood that the specific drug being considered will inhibit or reverse the progression of the disease being treated

This is the tentative part. COVID-19 is a novel virus, so there are currently no rigorously proven treatments other than general stabilization and support.

You have to consider all of these factors and ask yourself ""Are the risks associated with prescribing this drug greater than the risks associated with not prescribing it?"" What are the risks associated with prescribing or not prescribing HCQ to a COVID-19 patient (assuming the pharmacist does his job and eliminates patients at risk of adverse drug interaction)?

Prescribing: They may experience mild side effects such as headache, nausea, or skin irritation, and it might not actually help treat their COVID-19 infection.

Not prescribing: They may be needlessly hospitalized or even die if it's true that HCQ is an effective treatment.

Given the huge disparity of risk between these two options, it seems like an easy decision.

I'll close with an anecdotal example of my own, to illustrate how doctors do this sort of ""shotgun approach"" all the time. I had Bell's Palsy a few years ago. Bell's Palsy can be caused by all sorts of things, so my doctor prescribed me a combination of potent antibiotics, antivirals, and steroids. The side effects of that combination of drugs was horrendous, but it was better for me to endure 10 days of nausea, vertigo, etc. if any one of those drugs would help return motor function to my face. The alternative would have been trying just one drug at a time and potentially having my face paralyzed for several weeks longer while we found the specific drug that would treat the underlying ailment that caused my facial paralysis.",,2020-04-01 17:14:23,{},fm4uwix,False,t3_fsllab,False,True,t1_fm2tsa2,/r/COVID19/comments/fsllab/no_evidence_of_rapid_antiviral_clearance_or/fm4uwix/,1585762595,1,True,False,COVID19,t5_2f4l19,0,1585754063.0,1585761471.0,,

Overdose with ibuprofen, whilst less common, is difficult to treat especially compared to paracetamol (acetaminophen) where we can treat you as soon as you come in the front door. 

Generally ibuprofen is a relatively more dangerous (relatively being the operative word!) drug than paracetamol. Ibuprofen is definitely not the ‚Äúsafest form of pain relief imaginable‚Äú

With regard to the relation between COVID and ibuprofen - there is no *strong* evidence for this link. The advice has originated from some small studies which have suggested NSAIDs can worsen chest infections and also some theoretical work (that‚Äôs where the angiotensin receptors come in).  
The advice to not start ibuprofen is the WHO taking extra precaution currently. Importantly if you already take an NSAID, it is safe to continue with your current medications rather than change it until and unless there is *strong* evidence to the contrary 

Tl:dr ‚Äî&gt; paracetamol is generally safer than ibuprofen. There is no *strong* evidence that ibuprofen specifically worsens COVID at this time

I‚Äôm optimistically cautious on how this is used/implemented. TR has always seemed to me like the hardcore racers unique solo plan, focused on gains. On one side (which I think is the main point of this update) you have an individual-specific training plan/block that you can throw in a few social workouts without much disruption to the block (if you do so smartly, or maybe within the team setting). This is less of an issue with COVID, and maybe even more beneficial mentally. Could also provide some social accountability-related performance gains (like having a coach watch your progress). 

On the other hand, they could also set themselves up for future social racing (not workouts only) like Zwift. Personally I‚Äôve never been a fan of the animations on Zwift, but if TR had a nice UI, I might be more interested in social racing. Maybe people who are in the same block schedule, or some TR-user designated A/B races, or ‚Äúsegments‚Äù to KOM in some sense.

Anyway, I didn't get as much from this episode as the pilot, which, I mean the pilot is the big introduction so that's to be expected. 

Madison and Travis go to pick up Nick... and leave Alicia to get home herself. Since in the previous episode she was dragged to the hospital each morning, she likely doesn't have her own car. Her family is always focused on Nick, but she really doesn't get that same attention. 

From the bus scene, it looks like Chris may not have many friends at school. When we see him later in the protest, he calls out his key trait -- he wants to be part of something. 

While we see an LAPD officer being given treatment for a bite by an EMT, but pretty much first-aid. Later, another LAPD officer is stocking up on water. So there is a disparity between who does and does not know even among first-responders. 

Madison lies to Tobias about having seen ""them,"" which I think is denial in the face of... well, a terrible apocalypse. But even after seeing Artie, and Tobias warning her (saying the desert will be safer), she still forgets to warn the Cruz family. 

Also, as I recently finished seasons 4&amp;5, i was reminded how spot-on the music and cinematography is in the first seasons.
