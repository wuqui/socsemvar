When I was a teen in the 80‚Äôs I got caught with birth control pills and basically got shamed, vilified and screamed at for having responsible sex with my monogamous boyfriend. My parents‚Äô reaction destroyed the connection we had, it took a very long time for it to come back somewhat and to this day I remember how cruel my mother was to me when she found my pills (my dad was somewhat more comprehensive but he didn‚Äôt stand up for me towards my mother‚Äôs abusive behavior). I‚Äôm 49 now and I remember exactly the words she said and how ashamed and bad she made me feel.        

I‚Äôm here to tell you not to feel ashamed, you did nothing wrong and you were being responsible which is admirable. Your parents are the idiots here. Don‚Äôt let them break you up with your girlfriend, you‚Äôre 17 and they have no authority to do that. I think you should explain to them why you have nothing to say until they apologize for their previous actions. There‚Äôs not much you can do if they insist on gaslighting you that you‚Äôre in the wrong - they‚Äôre the ones who screwed up on their parenting.
