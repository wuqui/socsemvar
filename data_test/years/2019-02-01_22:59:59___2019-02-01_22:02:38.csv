The result is that people didn't want to work at all and stayed on welfare forever. This is what was used to justify welfare reforms to the public. Instead of just reforming welfare they killed it off completely and replaced it with TANF.

Exact amounts are hard to come by but I know that when my aunt was on welfare in the 1980s they were very generous. When my aunt got divorced she ended up on welfare. There was nothing wrong with her except she didn't have a job. She was just an unemployed housewife who never worked.
