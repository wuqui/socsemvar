The second my heart rate started going up I would quit immediately, fearing I was brining on a Panic Attack and just **KNOWING** I was going to have a heart attack.

I too had horrible reactions to SSRIs and do not take them. I used to take .5mg of Xanax 3 times a day, but now I only take it at night, and as needed if an attack happens. Which, is fairly rare due to **DIET and EXERCISE**, in my case.

After gaining 40+ pounds a few years ago due to a depression and spiral due to an onslaught of attacks leaving me near agoraphobic. I finally snapped.

I told myself, ""Look, if it's going to kill you there's nothing you can do about it, so just do it. Just start walking, jogging, and dieting no matter HOW it feels. Anything is better than living in fear unable to do anything. So if it kills me, **SO BE IT**.""

That was the best decision I ever made, in my life.  Now I do Yoga every morning, jog, and work out a few times a week. I lost all the weight. My attacks are down from nonstop, to **every once in awhile**. 

And look, **I'M NOT** a ""*Yoga person""* if you know what I mean. I used to roll my eyes at it. But I have since eaten my words on the subject.  Yoga every morning has had a **TREMENDOUS** affect on my anxiety. And serves as a form of meditation and focus before I start my day. The benefits, for me, are too many to list.

I don't like working out in public. I do my Yoga at home, using the YouTube channel [Yoga With Adriene](https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene). I do my work outs at home as well.

Sorry for rambling, but exercise/jogging/yoga has done more for my attacks, than any medicine or doctor.   *(I am NOT condoning dropping your doctor, lol)*

Hope it helps,

This       is not to scare you. There are good tutors here who do excellent     work.   Follow these general rules to find a good tutor while avoiding  a    scam.

1. ‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Do       your due diligence before you hire anyone. Vouches are easily   faked.     Groups like Hwforcash are infamous for this. Don't rely on   vouches  or    karma to make your decision. Rely on their knowledge   base.
2. ‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Test       their knowledge. It's customary to ask the tutors to solve a  sample      question. Try limiting the size of the sample question to  10% of  your     potential order. Also if you can, tip the tutor for the  sample   question    if you are somehow not going to hire them. \*\* Ask  them   questions not    found on Google \*\*
3. ‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†Ask       if they're US Based and ask if they have graduated from College  and      from which school. There have been many cases here of tutors  who  have     been found to be just your regular high school student.
4. ‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†You       are on your own here. As the subreddit grows, so do the scams.     There's  a  very real chance you might end up with an extortionist. Try     your  best  to not reveal your university, at least on your first     interaction.  When  sending sample questions or regular questions, crop     identifying   information like name and college.
5. ‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†If       you do fall into a scam, promptly notify me and I will add their     names   to the scammer list. This will warn other students from making     the  same  mistake.
6. If       you don‚Äôt want to deal with scammers, join the new subreddit to  get      VERIFIED EXPERTS that have a proven track record in their  fields.   Each    tutor will be verified by the Mods to ensure that you  get the   best    person for the job.

**BOT SCAMMER ACCOUNTS (** [u/drnhfm\_bot](https://www.reddit.com/u/drnhfm_bot/) and [u/WantTheWeed](https://www.reddit.com/u/WantTheWeed/) **)**    are CURRENTLY SPAMMING EVERYONE IN THE COMMENTS USING FAKE    ACCUSATIONS  to discourage students from hiring real legitimate tutors.    **Don't  trust a word they say.   Anyone they mention are most likely the  best  tutors on the subreddit.   Check their comments to see who they  target  and you'll see that they   only target Tutors who have graduated  from the  most elite schools in   the US.**

I will keep warning the community of these scammer bots. If you want to hire safely, join the subreddit: [r/VerifiedTutorsforHire](https://www.reddit.com/r/VerifiedTutorsforHire/)
