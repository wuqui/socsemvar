Sure, being ignored sucks, but it's **not** ""unfair"", and you have to drop that attitude immediately. The world owes you nothing. Women owe you nothing. Be frustrated that you're not getting anywhere? That's fine. But never forget dating is basically a marketplace - if nobody wants what you're offering, it's not the fault of the ""buyers"" for not being interested in what you're ""selling""!

Might be you're approaching the wrong sort of women, might be you're sending the wrong kind of message, might be you're sending the right message to the wrong women, or vice versa. Might be you just don't appeal to many women, and that's a shame, it makes life harder, but nothing worth having comes easy. If there's only a handful of women out there who'd want to be with you, your job is to find them, not get mad at the women who don't.

The whole point of LOTR is that it's an adventure full of unexpected encounters, and it brings the characters through a literary genre ""levels"" journey: from a known and cosy place/feeling (the Shire) to a Heroic Romance (most of the book), to an Epic (anything related to fights and battles, climax), and finally to some parts of Mythological setting (lore background/poems, the Shadow of the Past, the praise to the Ringbearers, etc). In that matter, Tom Bombadil is a Fairy Tale halt between the known world and the beginning of Heroic, completing a full overview of those different existing genres (More precisely - the House of TB chapter is a clearly joyful fairy tale while the Barrow-Downs chapter leans more on the darker side of this genre).

Tom is a mystery, which indeed started as an anomaly but Tolkien left it there to show that in any myth you'll have complete mysteries. I love his chapter because I really like the idea that not everything needs to be explained, and his Faerie elements are well done in a literary way (you can clearly see it's a fairy tale, but it's not like it changes anything to our general suspension of disbelief). Concerning his songs, they're not as serious and hold less poetic value than many other poems in LOTR (which isn't a trilogy btw, despite being originally published in 3 volumes), but they still follow faerie elements and have their merits. I wouldn't say, in any way, that they are badly written.",False,False,,,2020-09-01 21:55:04,,False,{},g3nb8lf,False,t3_ikek6t,False,True,t1_g3lqw5t,/r/tolkienfans/comments/ikek6t/finished_the_lotr_today/g3nb8lf/,1599006577,1.0,True,False,tolkienfans,t5_2r6jm,,0.0,[],1598990104.0,,
