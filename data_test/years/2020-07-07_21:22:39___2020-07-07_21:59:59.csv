Sorry to hear about our tooth ache. Since it doesn't appear to be a periodontal gum issue, it was NOT from your cleaning.

You are undergoing Invisalign. Alot of strange things happen in your mouth from teeth shifting. The ligament holding the tooth expands and the teeth become sore. 

Is your regular dentist doing your Invisalign? You should let whoever is doing your Invisalign know about your discomfort.

It could be this as well, but impossible to say for sure without an xray of the tooth and a clinical eval. Because of the existing filling on the tooth, it could be Endo related, meaning it could need a *root canal*. In which case, you will need to go to an Endodontist  for a consultation.

If you had QM1, you must have heard of momentum space and configuration space and how can go from one representation from another.

Consider you are in momentum space and you have a state vector |p&gt;. you can obtain this state vector in configuration space by using a Fourier transformation:

|p&gt; = int (dx e\^(-ipx) |x&gt;)

If you apply with momentum operator on |p&gt; and assuming it is a eigenvector of this operator, then: P|p&gt; = p|p&gt; where p is the eigenvalue.

Then

P|x&gt; = int( dp e\^(ixp)P|p&gt;) = int( dp e\^(ixp) p|p&gt;) = int(dp -id/dx e\^(ipx) |p&gt;) = -id/dx int(dp e\^(ipx) |p&gt;) =  -id/dx |x&gt;

Which means that the momentum operator in the configuration space can be represented as:

P -&gt; -id/dx.
