I'm taking a dating break right now while I sort out some things in my personal life.

After my last situationship, I realized I DO want something serious. I was always okay with going with the flow, but not anymore. So that will be something I will be expressing to my dates once I start that up again. When you're happy alone, open, direct, honest communication about your needs/wants sounds less daunting. 

I've also realized I gave a lot of guys the benefit of the doubt or didn't expect much of them since it was so early on in the dating process. I'm now realizing that I need to focus more on actions vs words.

Granted both cases are wrong, but it’s just shitty in feeling for the people being flamed. 

I personally feel that while I despise the toxicity in the community, I think outside of racism, sexism, homophobia, etc things along that line, just let people play. No reason to ban an entire account. It’s just an excuse for them to make more money off of someone who is toxic which is a good percentage of the community. People sink thousands of dollars into their accounts sometimes only to lose it. It’s their fault because they know the system, but it’s kind of shit.
