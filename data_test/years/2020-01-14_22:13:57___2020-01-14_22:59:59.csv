I don't know what exactly you have in mind, but please be careful with this one and do your research beforehand. Mountains there may look like from a fairytale, but randomly picking one to hike in wintertime may turn out to be a very dangerous activity if you don't know *exactly* what you're getting yourself into (and sometimes even if you do). Even innocent beginner-friendly paths can become deadly during winter as it's easy to slip on the ice and fall. If in doubt, consult the locals.
