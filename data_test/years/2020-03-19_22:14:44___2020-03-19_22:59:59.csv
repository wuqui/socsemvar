Many Mustang owners lower their car too far, and the camber goes too far out of spec - you can no longer adjust the top of the strut far enough to get the wheel aligned properly.  In this case, you'll need to install some 'adjustment bolts', like these:

These replace the top bolt out of the two that hold the strut to the wheel hub.  With the adjustment bolt installed and the other strut bolt loose, rotate the adjustment bolt with a ratchet and this will give you more camber.  Here's a sample video that shows you the camber change, watch the hub as the adjustment bolt is rotated:
