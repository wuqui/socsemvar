Legal protection for paper assets can be questionable. They see real estate as safer. In the US, capital markets are insanely efficient by comparison, and it’s been de facto government policy for decades to get more people more into the stock market, even more than  real estate (which we also promote heavily both for personal and investment purposes).

It wasn’t always this way. Like middle class Americans used to be really into insurance-based products like annuities and whole life insurance because it was very inefficient to invest as an individual even if people basically trusted that their stock holdings enjoyed legal protection. My feeling is that the long-term direction of real estate, too, is to ultimately move toward a public corporate/REIT model rather than a zillions of small landlords model.
