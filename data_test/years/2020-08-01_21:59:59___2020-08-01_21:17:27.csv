Half the studies listed in that report conclude that there is insufficient evidence to establish any conclusion on wether or not children spread the virus (which is exactly what I said in the other post I replied to you with).

A lack of evidence only means that children are not being tested enough. **As I have explained to you** this is likely a result of the fact that children often don’t show symptoms and thus don’t often get tested, and that schools were among the first facilities to close meaning kids have been pretty well quarantined.

Additionally, I don’t think life for a 5’10” person is significantly different from your life right now. You are going from an average height (you’re really not that short my guy) to a slightly taller average height. If this is about women then I don’t think the women you will get at that height are really any different. I would also imagine that it will be a lot harder for you to work out and you will have a disproportionately small upper body as well since it’s a leg lengthening surgery. You’re not gonna turn into Chris Hemsworth overnight from this. You weigh 130lbs right now, that is much more “undersized” than your height. As someone who was previously 5’11” 140lbs I can promise you that women were not swooning over that build until I put on a bunch of muscle.

Want something to be confident about? You have saved up a fat stack of cash. Spend it on some personal training and nutrition advice. Buy a house or some rental properties.

I know the clicky pen spring sounds funny, but it just plain works. It's got enough pressure to pop the lock back, but is light enough to unlock when the 22lr bolt comes forward. Fostech counters their heavy trigger lock spring with a high powered bcg spring, but fuck all that noise, in my opinion.  
  
Take down your gun, insert 22lr bcg with fostech auto sear trip, and anti bounce weight if you want it, swap the trigger lock spring real quick, and you're good; at least from my experience.

Why would its 'design' matter? Why couldn't people get addicted to fiction?

&gt;Mind you, it isn't the consumption here, but the item in question. A book can tell a story, but you decide to get emotionally invested. 

A book can absolute evoke feelings from the reader that they did not expect. Plots do not necessarily progress in a linear and obvious fashion.

&gt;A song can tell a story with its lyrics, but the music it is set to is designed to make you feel things. You have no choice, give no consent.

This is weirdly puritanical. People listen to music to help cause a mood they want to feel - they absolutely choose it.
