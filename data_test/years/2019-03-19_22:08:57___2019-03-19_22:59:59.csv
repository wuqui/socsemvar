,travelthief,,,[],,,,text,t2_ibsag,False,,"Follow your heart. Nothing wrong with loving someone. It‚Äôs truly a gift to experience. 

None of us really know the relationship you have or what kind of person either of you really are. 

Time will tell. **Don‚Äôt ignore the red flags**. Red flags can be hiding their phone, or catching them in small lies. Red flags like other people messaging you asking if you‚Äôre dating her, or absurdly high snapchat scores and texting apps.    Jealousy and projection. My X told me she was being absused and that‚Äôs why she ended up moving in with me. I don‚Äôt think that was ever true. To a BPD abuse could be her parents raising their voice at her. 

Big red flag is tantrums when they don‚Äôt get that they want. You‚Äôll know it when you see it. Follow your gut. 

The trap is that you don‚Äôt expect them to cheat on you. They ‚Äúlove bomb‚Äù you and convince you that they ‚Äúcould never love anyone else‚Äù. My X had wedding planned and baby names picked out. She called me her husband daily and how she‚Äôd die if we weren‚Äôt together. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt want to marry you‚Äù she said for years. 

Imagine my surprise when her ‚Äúboyfriend‚Äù messaged me asking if I was also her boyfriend. Im discovering that she manipulated about 4 other guys in the two years we dated into falling in love with. I ignored it because the sex was other worldly. 

Because I ignored the flags I ended up in a worse case scenario. Do not give her your money, do not move in with her, do not make her problems your problems. 

And last and most importantly don‚Äôt let her disrespect you or cheat or lie to you and stay in your life. If she really loves and respects you, she‚Äôll be honest.
