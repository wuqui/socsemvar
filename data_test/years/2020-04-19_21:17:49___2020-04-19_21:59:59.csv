I had this project in mind before lockdown stuff started but it's become something to keep me going over the past couple of weeks! Overall it didn't take much time but I've just done a bit at a time for a few hours here and there. The raw material was the absolute ugliest, highly flammable set of polyester pink lace-trimmed ruffled bedsheets from the thrift store and I tried to use as much of the original lace and ruffles as possible. 

For the bloomers I did a modified version of the [Antipope tutorial](http://www.antipope.org/feorag/gosurori/bloomers-pattern.pdf). For the off-the-shoulder top, I followed the (excellent) [tutorial from Annika Victoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNvUKe4s97c&amp;vl=en). The camisole top is based on one I already have, and the face mask pattern I made up. The vibe I was going for is 80s film prom x sleepover set and to do the original ugly fabric justice and I think I sort of achieved that.

No teacher in their right mind would ever use the Bourbaki volumes as pedagogical texts, but the Bourbaki group consisted of many of the most influential mathematicians of the time, so it's not inconceivable that the Bourbaki way of thinking had a significant effect on mathematics education (at least at the university level).

Arnold might also be railing against the work of the French school of algebraic geometry (lead by Jean-Pierre Serre, Alexander Grothendieck and later Pierre Deligne), who ""took the geometry out of algebraic geometry"" by pioneering the use of schemes and category theory in AG. Many of the Bourbaki group (mostly active from the 1930s to 1950s) were the mentors of the FSAG (mostly active from the 50s to the 70s), so it's not a stretch to argue that the Bourbaki way of thinking lead to the very ""formalism over intuition"" style of the FSAG.

A joke which typifies the French school goes like this: a British mathematician is giving a talk about algebraic geometry at IHÉS (Paris Uni), and says ""let V be an affine variety..."" (an affine variety is the set of common zeroes of a set of polynomials, the most basic object of study in AG). One of the French graduate students is confused, and asks his advisor, ""What's an affine variety?"" His advisor replies: ""it's simply a reduced, irreducible separated scheme of finite type over an algebraically closed field, which is isomorphism to the spectrum of a commutative ring"".

Pregabalin is another standard treatment, which activates the Gaba receptor.  Not sure if there are studies, but I imagine there are.  It didn't work for me, but my mom takes it.

Many doctors will be familiar with the above treatments.  But doctors who work at pain clinics are usually the most knowledgeable. 

There are fewer studies on testosterone, but one happens to be on post-menopausal women (who are by definition low in testosterone).  If she is pre-menopause, consider that hormonal birth control can lower testosterone (especially estrogen-based types).  There are of course other birth control methods without this issue.  If the above don't  apply, then it can't hurt to check testosterone (standard blood test).  Her regular doctor might order a blood test, but treating women with low testosterone is a very specialized thing (it's usually for older women, who need a number of hormones to be boosted), so you'd have to hunt around to find someone to treat it.  Even endocrinologists often shy away from treatment with sex hormones, except in extreme cases.

Thanks for looking out for your girlfriend.  This is a tough thing to treat, but I have seen dramatic improvements with some of these treatments and some natural stuff (like fish oil).
