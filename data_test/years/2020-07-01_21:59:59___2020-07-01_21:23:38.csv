Their voting records are fully matters of public record, but look at the [Human Rights Campaign scorecard](https://www.hrc.org/resources/congressional-scorecard) for condensed versions presented in neutral language - and not all of it is about LGBTQ rights. But don't expect strictly neutral language from me.

Keep in mind that all that is being asked is for lgbtq folk to have the right to live with the same protections and opportunities as everyone else. They're not asking for unfair advantages, just asking people to stop tearing down the lives that they're trying to build. They want their spouses to get the benefits that they've earned through their service to this country. They want kids to not go through the same pain that they themselves suffered.  

Go ahead. Read the [2014th Congress summary there](https://assets2.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/114thCongressionalScorecard.pdf?_ga=2.56258475.1445087185.1593639378-3676619.1593639378) and see. Time and again, all that is asked is for simple things like not being able to lose their jobs as military contractors just for being who they are. Amendment 1079. 183 Democrats, 29 Republicans in favor. 5 Democrats abstained. 213 Republicans against. Amendment defeated. 

To contrast what those same politicians WOULD take a stand on, look at the very next one. Amendment 1115, voted on a year later. Entities under contract with the government who commit fraud against the government *must still be paid as if they hadn't* even if they don't do the job that they're being paid to do. Passed in a block by 227 Republicans.

There was not a war in 1973.  It is a nice piece of Israeli propaganda, but it is not accurate.  The war of 1967 did not end when the ground operations ended.  Israel occupied the East Bank of the Suez Canal and closed the canal in June 1967.  Thus, the Egyptians and the Israelis were facing each other across the canal; the Syrians were facing the Israelis on the other side of the Golan Heights.  At no time was there an armistice or a treaty or anything else for that matter.  Combat operations were continuously ongoing.  The Israelis were regularly bombing targets in Egypt and Egypt, with Soviet assistance, built an air defense network with Russian missiles.  In 1973, the Egyptians counter-attacked finding the Israelis napping...when they should not have been.  When you are in a continuous war, you have to expect that your foe would try to surprise you, if he/she can.  The Israeli forts of the Bar-Lev line were quickly overwhelmed.  And so on...So, it is not that Israel was in peace with its neighbors and it was attacked without provocation.  The war was ongoing.

I've met and seen plenty of people who are thrilled when one of these places moves into their town. The facebook group from a towns over got one and it was almost a political movement of people who were so thrilled about it and arguing against those who were. To these people, ""cheapest store"" = ""best store"". 

Meanwhile, it is bleeding their local grocery store, which is the only source of fresh produce, meat, and basically anything remotely healthy. They've had to lay off a ton of staff and I'd be surprised if they are still around in a year or two. Most of these people will notice when the grocery store is gone, not now. I know this because I go to that store sometimes and talked to one of the assistant managers.

They are fundamentally buying into the idea that it is going to be great for their wallets. Most people are not thinking about the macroeconomics of the convenient store industry or the hit to their local economy, they are thinking about their family and how to get through the day. General consumers are usually just not that informed or interested in this kind of stuff, rich or poor.

And obviously $20 a month matters to some people, but most of these communities are not that level of extreme poor. They are the working class poor. They can't afford a $500 trip to whole foods every week, but they can afford an extra $20 to pick up some fresh produce and meat along with .20 cents extra on their 12 pack of diet soda. Often times that would be part of EBT benefits. Speaking of produce, I should mention that it is much cheaper to feed your family on it than easy mac and chips.

And yes, it may only be a $20 a month difference, like I said the dollar general, etc is really not that much cheaper in the longer run. it just encourages poorer  short-sighted purchase planning. You can get a single roll of toilet paper for $1 or a pack of 6 for $3.99 at other low cost stores. In this scenario, is the dollar store being a savior of the poor, or exploiting them? All it does it free them up to spend more money on bad purchase decisions.

Plus where do people get the goods they can't get at a dollar store? Yes, some suffer without them, but others realize they need to feed their family some real food every now and then. So it just means they have to spend the gas money to drive further out to a real store to buy produce.

At the end of the day, these dollar general stores are costing people more, not less.
