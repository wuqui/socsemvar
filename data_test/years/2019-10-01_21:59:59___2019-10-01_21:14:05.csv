I have disposable income and I honestly wouldn't really mind rolling for Red. But I already have Blue because of the apology gems. And when I got Olivia from gems from story mode, I already had the meta character. Also managed to get Phoebe from the apology gems. 

Like, what else do I need? I could use Brendan or Kris. They'd be cool to have. But for what? EX VH challenges? Do I even need the 2 star gear for anything? I mean, I got most of the rock gear from Skyla, which I did farm, to be fair, but after a while it got boring. It took me so many runs just to get some of the gear. I can't be arsed getting it to level 15 and the Bracelet just doesn't drop enough. 

Who is realistically going to whale just to get Phoebe, Olivia, Kris and Brendan? Barely anyone. Brendan really is the only real cool character. Maybe they'll push for Hilda and Blue after that. But it really doesn't take too much to get those and when you have them, there really isn't much you can do with them. 

The whales left too, hence the game dropping to 185. There is no point in whaling. You only need select few characters to do missions to get gear you don't really need.

When you are a young man who isn't very sexually aggressive, it can be quite frustrating to notice girls in your life complaining about how all they want is a nice guy, but then going out with what seem like a series of assholes.   

This is a real phenomenon.  It isn't in our head.  But, some guys get so bent of shape about the ""injustice"" of it all that they become the ""nice guys"" being referred to here. 

IMHO their problem isn't that they aren't seeing a real phenomenon, but how they interpret their own role in it. There is no nice guy / asshole dichotomy.  Women (and others) tend to be attracted to confidence, and confident guys are disproportionately assholes.  Conversely, what some guys think of as ""being nice"" is actually being entirely asexual. They just do things for their female friends over and over, and then get upset when this doesn't automatically result in the girls being attracted to and having sex with them. Among the myriad of problems with this approach is that it assumes the only legitimate role of male/female friendships is sexual conquest. 

What they need to do is figure out how to be confident and attractive in a way that works for them, and learn how to approach women without a sense of entitlement about the outcome. Eventually they'll be good enough at it that the situation won't seem so unfair anymore.
