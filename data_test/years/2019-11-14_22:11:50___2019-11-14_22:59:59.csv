Restrictions on open carrying a firearm
NFA weapons restriction
Waiting period to purchase a firearm
Background checks
Red flag laws

Assaulting someone is illegal
Brandishing a firearm is illegal
Shooting at someone is illegal
Shooting someone is illegal
Carrying a firearm in a Gun Free zone is illegal
MURDER IS ILLEGAL

What more do do you think could have been done to prevent this since obviously the hundreds of laws on the books already don't. Making firearms illegal won't do a thing - just look at Chicago or Mexico. Both have huge problems with firearm violence and both are extremely regulated.
