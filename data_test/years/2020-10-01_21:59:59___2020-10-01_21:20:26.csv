The feedback below is not necessarily correct. (BUT again, in this case, you're OK.)

Authenticating to [Gmail.com](https://Gmail.com) does not connect the rest of your browser session history to your corporate data. However, if you're authenticated to Chrome as your work identity which is *extremely common* for the use of all kinds of corporate extensions/apps, settings, etc. It **doesn't matter what network or device you're on, nor is access to your device required.** As an Admin, there are dozens of tools that give me access to this data, or I could simply change your PW and access your account - *everything* you did associated with this Chrome browser profile is now mine because I'm now *you* as far as the system is concerned.

I would note, Incognito Mode is handy but the only device that 'cares' about this setting is your client device - everything else down the line has all the same information they would as if it were a standard Chrome session. Also, if it's a corporate device (I know it wasn't here) there are all kinds of software that allow an admin to watch your screen in realtime or watch your screen at any point in the past. 

All that said, an overwhelming number of companies don't go to this much trouble outside of extreme circumstances. It's not in their interest to know your personal life unless they're trying to protect other employees or corporate data. Be nice. Be honest. Do your job. Everyone goes Incognito sometimes - it's good for company morale :)",False,False,,,,2020-10-01 21:35:12,,False,{},g7c10fe,False,t3_j3etzw,False,True,t3_j3etzw,/r/gsuite/comments/j3etzw/can_admin_see_browsing_history_when_logged_in_on/g7c10fe/,1601601936,1,True,False,gsuite,t5_3gmms,,0,[],1601580912.0,[],text,t2_7abyhogf,False,False,,
