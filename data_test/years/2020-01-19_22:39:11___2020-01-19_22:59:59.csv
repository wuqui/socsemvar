But the force was criticised by the Home Affairs Select Committee and told by its chairman Keith Vaz they needed to ""get a grip"".
Rotherham was not the only community in the North and the Midlands to have uncovered such abuse. There have also been arrests or prosecutions of groups of men in 11 towns and cities, including¬†Oldham, Rochdale¬†and¬†Derby.
""In the other cases, overwhelmingly, they were men of Pakistani origin and we need to understand why this has been happening,"" said Mr Norfolk.
He described¬†a previous report into gang exploitation¬†as a ""missed opportunity"" because of its failure to look at the proportion of men of Pakistani origin committing such offences.""

Pinching should use the same thickness implement. Training with different thicknesses is a good idea, but those should be considered separate exercises. Using dumbbells works better if you stick with one at a time, and chain weight to it, then use other sizes for training a different ROM. 

Most people don‚Äôt care much about finger/thumb extension details like that. But if you like doing more motions, it‚Äôs 100% fine.

Different wrist motions do have muscles in common. But it‚Äôs more complicated than just that.

* For strength, you don train muscles, so much as train motions. Strength comes from your brain, too. It needs practice with neural firing patterns to make a motion stronger over time. This doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you need shitloads of volume on the new exercise, if you‚Äôre already doing enough to build mass, however.

* There are small muscles that deviation trains that the curls don‚Äôt. And while the main muscles of those 4 exercises are involved in the 2 rotational ones, they‚Äôre not the main ones. All of those other muscles help prevent pain, and help your strength in other ways. It‚Äôs helpful to train them, even if it‚Äôs just one hard set of 15 each. Like a workout finisher.

* In terms of strength, wrist curls are more meant for beginners. They‚Äôre good for convenience, as they use common gym equipment, and they‚Äôre good for mass and connective tissues. But for more advanced strength trainees, they‚Äôre better used as a mass builder. Deviations are easier for most people to load heavier, so are better for pure strength. This isn‚Äôt a black-and-white thing, and you‚Äôre not gonna be weak and such, if you don‚Äôt switch over.
