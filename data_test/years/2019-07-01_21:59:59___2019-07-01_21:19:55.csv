He basically hulked the fuck out and they had to call some security dudes in to restrain him. After that they just kinda let him walk around in his old worn out slippers. 

Then there was another time where this old woman would go to the largest window in the recreational area, and she would shout at the top of her lungs ‚ÄúOOOOOH, OOOOOH, OOOOOH‚Äù. When the nurses asked her what she was doing she said she was ‚Äúcalling for an ambulance that would take her back home‚Äù I suppose since they transport patients by ambulance, she assumed that one would take her back too or something. The nurses got her back to her room, and she continued to make periodic siren noises, and shortly afterward a nurse went to shut her door as she was showing no sign of stopping. Not gonna lie, I got a pretty good chuckle from hearing her muffled ambulance siren noises from the other side of the door.
