There is no magic bullet to starting or restarting or continuing. Nobody can give you motivation. 
 
Ultimately you build discipline and commit, or you don't. Control and motivation are not about willpower really, they are about discipline, creating a new normal, and also goals. The scale itself is often not enough motivation, and motivation can only get you so far versus discipline. 

As you have noticed, motivation is fleeting and can be affected by external factors. But discipline and building something into your daily habit can help ensure success even when you don’t feel “motivated” in a given moment to continue as you’ve been going.

Discipline is basically building good habits and sticking to them. You have to ask yourself what is more important to you: being less fat in a month or having a candy bar now? What is going to provide more long term satisfaction?

Frankly there is always an excuse to cheat. There is always an upcoming holiday or birthday or graduation or quincenara or bar mitzvah or other celebration or someone decided to just bring cookies to work or you go out to dinner and order a sandwich instead of something else. There is always an excuse, if you want it bad enough you will just not make excuses.

Which is not to say it isn't difficult, it IS to say that committing is what is necessary especially when you are in an environment where others eat other things.

Stress happens, keto or no. I’m a busy person, I manage to plan, meal prep, and keep keto. I go out with friends when stressed and keep keto. Don’t let stress or being busy be your excuse. 

With regard to emotional eating, if you’re doing that, develop other/better coping strategies that actually address the underlying feelings. ""Eating your feelings"" is just a bandaid and does not actually get to the deeper issue. 

A lot of people also say that thinking, ""I no longer eat that"" is a more helpful mindset versus ""I can't have that.""

If you cheat and fail, reflect critically on why it happened, don't go into a shame spiral - make a plan for the next time the situation comes up, because it will, and think about a better way to handle it.

Committing to changes that improve your health can be hard. Being fat is also hard. Choose your hard and stop making excuses. You have to want it, nobody can want it for you.
