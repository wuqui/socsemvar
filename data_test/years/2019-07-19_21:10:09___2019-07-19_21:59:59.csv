[],,506702,,,[],,,,text,t2_3aadtkzr,False,,"I've ordered from Balance Athletica's first Kingdom Collection Pre-sale. All my pieces are squat proof and gives minor camel (I am just prone to it) and washes well (inside out on cold, hang to dry). Many reviews say that the OG pant is comparable to Lululemon Aligns and I have to disagree; the OG pant has a brushed, thicker fabric but nowhere as soft or thin as Aligns. OG pants haven't pilled on me and it feels they're able to handle more intense workouts The Ascend pants are dubbed as the performance pant and it has lots of give (I would recommend to size down if you are between sizes). I am also really fond of the fact that they lined the interior with the matching based colour (ie orange layer with King Cheetah, red with the Copperhead etc), so when you squat, the pattern doesn't go white. The Ascend top has a mesh layer side the back, which makes the bra feel very breathable, however I found the straps tend to slip esp if I haven't got my sweat on. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 165 cm, 56kg, 34 A; I usually wear all Lululemon bottoms and bras in 4 and I got all smalls in the Ascend top (Copperhead), OG pant (black), and Ascend pant (King Cheetah). If I were to reorder again, I would probably go down to a XS in the Ascend top (proud member of IBTC) and Ascend pants (I don't have a huge butt or wide hips so I have excess fabric in the crotch area). I'd say due to the more compressive nature of the OG pant, you could go with your true size or size up for lounging comfort.    


I've tried Ptula as well, just the Alainah III in Marina Blue and the Veronica bra in Seafoam, both in size small. The Alainahs have a brushed fabric but are thicker than Aligns (even thicker than OG Pant) which is feels sturdier for weightlifting and other higher intensity workouts. Marina Blue is a blue-y mint colour and I could squat with a black thong and you couldn't see anything. Minor camel tho. The seam on the bottom of the leggings does contour your calf but can leave a mark when you take them off. I am not super fond of the Ptula logo placement on the bottom of the leg, its too big and distracting to me. I ended up returning the Veronica bra, the sides of the bra is cut too high and straps gathered unflatteringly around my traps (I tried it on for 10 mins and it left my traps aching).  I probably should have gotten a medium but the style wasn't flattering or unique enough for me to keep.  

&amp;#x200B;

Between these two IG brands, I like Balance as their fits and patterns work better with my body shape (I've been stopped so many times by girls asking about the King Cheetah leggings) but I'm probably going to stick with Lululemon, as it is way more accessible and the weak Canadian dollar doesn't make these brands anymore price competitive.  I am still a die-hard for Free to Be Serene bras and In Movement leggings.",False,False,,2019-07-19 21:23:19,,False,{},eu94cr0,False,t3_bx9a4x,False,True,t3_bx9a4x,/r/lululemon/comments/bx9a4x/has_anyone_ever_ordered_anything_from_balance/eu94cr0/,1563571401.0,1.0,True,False,lululemon,t5_2tma3,0.0,1563564199.0,

I will automatically update the flair so that only one person is working on a post at any given time.

When you're done, please comment again with `done`. Your flair will be updated to reflect the number of posts you've transcribed and the post will be marked as completed.

Here's [a checklist](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/wiki/checklist) that might help you out -- not just for newbies!

Post type: image. Please use the following formatting:

---

**Note:** To use these format guides, all you have to do is copy and paste everything within the blue markdown box and replace the prompts with the relevant information. The two asterisks turn any text between them into boldtext, and the three hyphens in a row when separated by a blank row above and below will become a horizontal rule. 

**Remember:** We want to transcribe the text directly, please do not make corrections to typos or grammatical errors, but feel free to use [sic] to indicate that the text is exactly as in the original. Please copy and paste any emojis into your transcription.

[],,Jeanes223,,,[],,,,text,t2_ktgjy3z,False,,"The story of my great grandfather in WW2 was one of not going to look for a fight(drafted) and not really giving a rat's ass once in service. Initially trained to run AA stateside, and during training rarely hit the dummy aircraft sent gliding over the shooting range. Unfortunately, a training mishap by way of a civilian aircraft wandering into military air space occured. Of course one of the only ones they actually hit was a live plane. To keep this incident under wraps, the unit was put on boats and sent to England.

Whilst in England the general idea of ""What are they going to do, bust me down a rank and put me in the brig,"" was the staple of his existence. His 1st Sgt busted him and his buddy with one of the Queen's Pheasants boiling in a pot. Apparently hunting the queens game is a big offense. A short stint in the brig, and he was to go to Germany. Somewhere in here appendicitis came about and Great Grandfather found himself as an infantryman in Patton's 3rd Army. 

Patton was everything he history books make him out to be. He had a mouth on him, he knew what he was about, and he played by his rulebook and to hell with any other rulebooks. According to great grandpa, ""The movies have it all wrong. If you were in Pattons army and you weren't assigned to a tank, you didn't get no free rides anywhere. You marched and marched and marched."" Now, according to the history books, Patton made that run to Bastogne in record time and it was amazing. According to the old man, and the source of WW2 history debates between our family and history teachers, Patton moved out to Bastogne well before he ever received orders to do so. He was several days on the road when orders came in to move out. Bastogne was cold, freezing cold, supplies were limited, food was scarce. Great grandpa and a couple men crawled through the snow looking for dead animals, found themselves behind enemy lines and found a horse that had been killed and frozen in the snow. They managed to slice off a quarter of meat for his little squad and smuggle it back out. They boiled it, ate it, said he liked it but never ate horse again because it could have been the hunger that made it so tasty. When the unit moved out the next day the lines had shifted, they marched near where the horse had been found and as far as he could tell others had found the horse, as there was no trace of easily obtained meat remaining on the carcass.

The battle commences and great grandpa finds himself in a bad way. The radio man had been gunned down. Great grandpa was assigned task of radio man and had to stick tight to Pattons hip. This was not pleasant as Patton had a tendency to stick his neck out way further than it needed to be. I do not recall the hill they were tasked to take but orders came through that the hill was unobtainable, and to fall back. Patton radioed in ""I'm not falling back off the hill, I'm standing on the fucking thing!"" The enemy line surged and a skirmish ensued over the contested hill. Patton and his forces were victorious, with great grandpa at one point pushing Patton out of the way of enemy fire. His reward was a bullet hitting his glasses and sjirting of his brow at a very shallow angle. Glass got in Great Grandpa's eye and that was his ticket for medical discharge from service. 

Great Grandpa was awarded the bronze service star and a purple heart for his service, of which he refused. ""I am not here because I want to be here, I'm doing my duty to my country and I will take no medals for participating in the acts of taking other men's lives."" My great uncle applied to receive the medals for Great Grandpa after he passed away a little over 10 years ago to bacterial meningitis. 

His story took years to get from great grandpa, told in different parts to his children and wife. A lot sounds skeptical, and it was a trying time in his life, hence the reserve he showed in telling the story. I was a young teen when he sat down and finally told the whole story from start to finish, nearly 60 years after the war was over.",False,False,,2019-07-19 21:24:49,,False,{},eu94hhw,False,t3_cf6cay,False,True,t3_cf6cay,/r/AskReddit/comments/cf6cay/serious_what_stories_about_ww2_did_your/eu94hhw/,1563571490.0,1.0,True,False,AskReddit,t5_2qh1i,0.0,1563564289.0,
