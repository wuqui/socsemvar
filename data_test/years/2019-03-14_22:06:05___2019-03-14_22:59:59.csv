&gt; So you are using a custom toolkit? Very few apps do that.

It's a rust app using conrod which is resolution independent:

https://github.com/pedrocr/chimper

But even if it was a GTK app I'd still like to be able to not have to do the 2x pixels for the main image viewport.

&gt; Not really. In discrete steps. And not everything (try file open or print dialog).

Definitely not discrete. Firefox has layout.css.devPixelsPerPx which you can set to whatever value you want. That scales both the UI and the page. Browsers are also using less and less extra windows in favor of putting things in tabs (e.g., donwloads, preferences, etc). Any of those extra windows that are indeed done with the native widget sets can just be marked to be scaled.

&gt; Here I'm not sure, where you take the 2x penalty. Again, scaling on GPU is almost free. Not even SW renderers would be 2x penalized, even if they have to write 2x more pixels. Unless you render in really random access pattern and wait for RAM.

Here's my pipeline:

https://github.com/pedrocr/imagepipe/

It goes from raw images from cameras all the way to a processed output. The scaling is done in the first step (demosaic from bayer to RGB) and then all the processing steps run in O(n pixels). If I double the output pixels that's a 2x performance regression. At the very least I should be able to know that 2.0-&gt;1.5x is happening so I just upscale the image on final output to the screen knowing that it's just going to be downscaled later. It's not a great solution for an image app where you want to control how any image scaling is being done but it may work in practice.

I don't know what the penalty is for browsers but I doubt it's small given that they've been trying to move to more and more GPU rendering to avoid all the CPU usage. It's probably easy to test with a browser rendering performance benchmark though.",False,False,,2019-03-14 22:40:19,,False,"{'gid_1': 0, 'gid_2': 0, 'gid_3': 0}",eijp2mm,False,t3_b0t2m4,True,t1_eijnmzu,/r/linux/comments/b0t2m4/gnome_332_released/eijp2mm/,1552603220.0,1.0,True,False,linux,t5_2qh1a,1552596019.0,
