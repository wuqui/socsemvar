Well, that's a similar problem. I guess it's good that someone who needs a tool once a year can buy one for $10 instead of $50 but it's hard to find nicer tools if you are inclined to spend the money. I do have to admit that a lot of the cheaper tools (but not the cheapest) are pretty damn good, actually probably good enough for the vast majority of people. The really expensive tools just feel better in your hand.

We just lost our electronics store. Not consumer electronics but stuff like cables, jacks, tools, resistors, small enclosures. To be honest, they never seemed particularly busy but if I was working on something and needed a resistor or plug or some wire to was nice to be able to walk half a mile and go buy it.

A while back there was a NYT story about fabrication shop in Manhattan that closed. They sold the building for more than the business ever made. Think about that. A business for 50+ years and most of the money they made came from selling the building. A lot of theaters and props departments used to go there to get custom work and repairs and now it's gone.

I can't fault someone for selling to the highest bidder, nor for trying to get the most for their money.

Scientists with decades of experience in the field, read peer reviewed scientific papers, and hold multiple education certificates and awards are criticising doctors on antibiotics. Stay at home mothers on facebook wanting attention and reading google news stories from 'Hello' magazine are criticising antibiotics.

Players moaned for spin settings to be concealed.  They got it. Things haven’t changed much.   

Now we see moans for concealing the entire shot on shootouts.  

Or here, to conceal a golf bag..  

I don’t like that ‘direction.’  

All those changes might help a handful of players ‘stay on top’ a little longer, but the skillful players will ‘get there’ soon enough.  In the meantime, with those changes,  the game becomes less entertaining.  

I don’t take this game so serious that I want to conceal every move I make in the play. 

Imagine me being required to ‘turn my back’ on a golf course while my golf opponent plays his shot?  Pretty ridiculous.  And “it’s not real golf” isn’t a good argument. This is a real game as is ‘real’ golf, so the comparison is valid.

I still have up and down days now but during the ups I have the theory that I want to believe so badly. That the pain confusion I feel isn't just mine, lots of people are aimless sometimes without knowing it, but bu holding contradictory viewpoints that halts their progress. I'm aware of my aimlessness, so now what? Well I'm not going to kill myself because I still believe despite all its tragedy life is still the best thing ever. So what now? I'll survive healthily for another 20 years then who knows. During my down days I think that maybe I'm one of the very few who see the wrong conversations being had and know that getting each side to understand each other is crucial otherwise conflicts escalates to war, and maybe humans don't have to make it, millions of people have ruined their own lives and of their loved ones that it's entirely possible that it's just part of the stronger nations to have these people and sometimes they get into power, maybe the game is too big though. Maybe we're actually risking everything by not moving forward, but eveybody just wants to fight. Maybe our failure to give up what we hold dear is what will kill us, maybe we're too proud or fear shame, but there's a bigger reason to suffer through everything to get to the other side and anybody who's done will say it's worth it but unless we can convince everyone there will always be a chance that a Hitler or an Oswald or a Comey will come along and quickly fuck everything up before everybody's had a chance to calm down. It isn't an event that'll be the end, humans die, why doesn't it make sense that when humanity matures itself too dies? 

So what now? Just be a good guy. Grow up, quit whining about things you can control and if you can't  make your own life better try to make it less worse for someone else.
