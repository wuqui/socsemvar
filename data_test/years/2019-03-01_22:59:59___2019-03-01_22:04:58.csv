I am curious to see how Stride interacts with Wilhelm in EX 3, though I suspect it will be like the early battle ballads in which he masks it as it being his ""merrymaking/entertainment"" or whatnot. I think from what I could gather, Stride was quite surprised he was able to defeat Kurgan the first time around in Picoutatte. And from what I could tell he, Stride himself, challenged Theresia himself in EX 3 but then quickly corrected himself saying that because she had renounced her sword, it would be Kurgan who fought as a proxy versus Wilhelm who would fight as a proxy for Theresia. Either way, maybe, though I think Wilhelm defeating Theresia was part of normal history personally.

And yeah, with the Magic Circles in effect, history was finally out of the control of the viewers, the Od Lagna, or whoever determines it. It could very well be that the cracks introduced from this will become relevant in the main story in Arc 7 or above... I really hope, Wilhelm is so conservative so far in the story in talking about what happened back then.

,KhorneSlaughter,,asc-necromancer,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Necromancer'}]",,Necromancer,dark,richtext,t2_sqtor,False,,"This system of armor can become problematic at high numbers, where it scales your ehp vs phys dmg to an insane degree, reaching infinite ehp at 100k armor. I believe a more linear scaling of ehp would be better.

At 0 Armour gaining 5k Armour gives you 5% more ehp. This is intuitive. At 50k armor gaining an additional 5k gives you 10% more ehp.
At 90k Armour gaining an extra 5k would give you 100% more EHP.
This seems unhealthy.

Instead Armour could be scaled so that every point of Armour gives you an equal proportional increase in EHP whether you are at 10k or at 50k Armour. Using the example above, 50k Armour could give 50% dmg reduction which would double your ehp but 100k could give 75% doubling your ehp again and 150k could give 87.5% doubling ehp a third time.

A third solution would be to actually have every point of armor reduce damage taken by a small percentage but apply this multiplicative to itself. 

This let's armor scale well without becoming too broken.

He thought Russia would have a bourgeois revolution of sorts and that him and his comrades would establish something like the SPD in Russia. That was the primary goal of Lenin until 1917.

The SPD still had the goal of transcending capitalism back in those days and was much more of a genuine Marxist party back then than it is today. Lenin saw it as a model and a goal to strive for.

I am not really an expert on Lenin and this time period though. I need to keep reading more. 

The book has already made two big claims though. It has stated that not only that establishment academic critics of Lenin get his thought wrong but also many Marxist admirers of him. 

It seeks to correct that with a deep analysis of What is to be Done and an analysis of the political and historical context of it.
