Nail bounce on HK's head during the first 2 phases to dodge his attacks.

When he's stabbing himself, don't bother attacking him. Any attack during this time will do only 1 damage. If you already have soul, just heal. If you need soul, then feel free to beat him up a bit.

If you don't have the Shade Cloak (like me), **stay away from the corners of the arena**. The Hollow Knight is massive and if he teleports up to you while you're in the corner, it's very hard to dodge him.

Also, if you're in a position where you can't dodge an attack, use the desolate dive. The invincibility frames will give you a chance to run.

When HK is holding his sword in front of his face, **DO NOT HIT HIM!** He will parry the attack and immediately use his triple slash attack, which will then hit you.

Do NOT let yourself get hit by the fire pillar attack. Do everything in your power to dodge it. The fire pillar attack deals **double** damage.

Ive never actually went to school for this stuff i just got a bunch of certifications but recently  i managed to interview for a full time position ""entry level inhouse IT work"" because the company had a bunch of employees walk out on them because of the covid situation so naivety got the best of me and i actually walked into this interview hopeful as hell that i would be the position because i had the prior experience and the interviewer did put it out there that there was a urgent need to fill the position. Boy was i wrong in the interview i literally get attacked over the fact that i dont have degree ""interviewer didnt give a shit about the fact that i had prior experience in the field at a high skill/responsibility level"" and i was greeted with some generic ass ""sorry but we are looking for someone more qualified for the position"" email a week later.",False,False,,,2020-07-14 21:45:39,,False,{},fy2x98g,False,t3_hqep0r,False,True,t1_fxxsc04,/r/lostgeneration/comments/hqep0r/cant_find_a_job_its_not_your_fault/fy2x98g/,1594788619,1.0,True,False,lostgeneration,t5_2r40j,,0.0,[],1594755939.0,,
