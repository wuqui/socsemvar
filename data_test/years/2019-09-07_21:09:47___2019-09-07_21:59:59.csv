[],,DarkLordRyan,,,[],,,,text,t2_qb5sjw,False,,"A few issues with your analysis: You say that Metroid needs to be technically innovative like Super and Prime to sell well. Super Metroid sold terribly though. I know that's such a strange thing to consider, but it's true.  


Secondly, why would Prime 2 and Halo 2 compete? They're very different games (Exploration First Person Adventure vs Linear FPS), on two completely different consoles, targeted to different audiences. I know people use Halo 2 as a crutch to explain away bad sales of Prime 2, but I think we can honestly blame it more on the Gamecube's kid demographic and lack of marketing. Prime 3 suffered a similar fate, being on a console intended for the vast ocean of non-gamers. That said, Prime 3 is to this day the most technically impressive Metroid game. Innovative motion controls that actually worked, visuals that look gorgeous to this day, smooth framerate, etc. Other M came out 3 years later and looks like a goddamn Dreamcast game.  


Finally, in what world is a story-focused Metroid game a good idea? Metroid's subtextual and environmental storytelling is legendary, using gameplay and mechanics to ultimately create a believable world. Of the two times a Metroid game has tried to put a lot of story focus before Other M, it only really worked in Fusion, and even then the cutscenes felt forced and overly intrusive. By Corruption it got even worse. But those were still good games, with good gameplay. Other M doesn't just have an overly intrusive story or even just have a bad story, but even when you take story out what you have is a generic, painfully repetitive, hand-holdy, run of the mill action game with none of what makes Metroid so unique.  


And then there's SR. I'm not gonna lie, in 2010 or so, I'd have loved it. But by 2017 we had seen so many Metroidvanias go above and beyond. Hollow Knight released the same year and destroyed it. Not to mention that the people Nintendo chose to entrust Metroid to were the same people that murdered Castlevania. And before you try to say SR's quality means that won't happen, the first LoS game was decent too. Then MoF and LoS2 came and killed the franchise. Great idea.

it would not be accurate to say that all summary offences are not criminal.

the distinction you're looking for is quite simply criminal vs. non-criminal offences. the clearest example being that any provincial offence would not be a criminal offence.
