[],,,clark-mc,,,[],,,,text,t2_410zkpnj,False,[],,"A shed of light emerges from the thinning roof of the ancient crypt. Howling winds rage from outside, angrily screaming to gain entrance inside of the desolate building. The boys mother will soon return as she always does. He sits next to a row of candles painstakingly aligned along the dust covered shelves. In his hand he holds a pebble, rolling it and shaking it in a loosely balled fist. He studies his shadow against the dancing flames, getting lost and then found again as the fire fights the unforgiving northern cold.

He stands and shuffles his way across the central room toward a rack of books. A thick wool blanket accompanies thicker worn tops and bottoms. He clutches the blanket with one hand, tightly pulling it in to himself. He extends his other hand to the spine of a red book and removes it from the row. He traces his fingers gently across the face of aged scripture as he has many times before. Latin scribe inherits the passages, along with illustrations and diagrams he is familiar with. The book his mother used to kill him.

A heavy presence shifts the numbing quiet. She's home. She moves with both with grace and decadence, dancing along the shattered web of cracks running along the floor. A slight smile emerges from the corner of the boys mouth. He has always loved the way she introduces herself to him. But she is also beautiful. Incredibly so. As she closes in on him, her features become more invigorating, more alive. She stops just below the peaking moonlight crashing down through the roof. Her snowy complexion remarkably perfect, reflecting the moonlight in divine fashion. Her hair as black as the space between the stars in the sky, perfectly resting along her flawless shoulders. A thin red gown flowing along the curves of her body. She smiles at her son, and he to her.

Without so much as a word, they begin toward each other. They collide near the candles. The loving embrace of his mother forfeits the hellish cold which only moments ago enveloped the boy. She places her hands on the frosty cheeks of the boy and retreats to the darkness of dining hall, gesturing for him to wait for her. He shoots his gaze down to the stone floor and again studies his shadow. She returns with a meal for the hungry child. Roasted pork. His favorite. And of course much more then he will eat. 

As the boy rests on a wooden bench illuminated by the candles, a noise echoes into the room. And with no where to go, the vibrations recycle several times over, until the sound remaining is that of the boy wiping his greasy hands along his trousers. The mother and child lie in wait again for the mysterious noise. 

A panel of glass belonging to the a stained portrait on the northern wall erupts, bursting into dozens of shards. The boy jumps to his feet. They have found him. They have found his mother. She places her hand on his shoulder and quietly guides him to the a hidden corner of the building. With out a word she leaves the boy. The quiet returns, but only for a moment.

And then. A howl, followed by a scream and a yelp. These are of pain. What follows are cries of terror, of desperation. But not from the boy, or from his mother. But those who hunt them. The boy lies down, using the blanket as a pillow and begins to drift into sleep. The unnerving screaming as calming to him as a heavy downpour. He is full and loved. No one will ever hurt him again. His mother will make sure of that.",False,False,,2019-11-01 22:50:18,,False,{},f61w7r5,False,t3_dq45jj,False,True,t3_dq45jj,/r/WritingPrompts/comments/dq45jj/wp_when_you_were_a_baby_your_mother_offered_you/f61w7r5/,1572648619.0,1.0,True,[],False,WritingPrompts,t5_2s3nb,0.0,1572641418.0,,

Unfortunately, it’s a cotton-poly blend which doesn’t work for me, does anyone know any where that carries a similar fit/featured knit button down?
