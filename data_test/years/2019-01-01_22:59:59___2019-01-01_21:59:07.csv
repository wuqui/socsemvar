I've been fighting crashes in Ark for a while.

Same pc I've used for over a year now, no new hardware or anything. I've been deleting certifications, editing registries, and lowering clock speeds. I have a 1080 gpu and a relatively beefy pc.

What finally fixed it was me rolling back the graphics drivers hard. Most current nvidia driver is like 417 I believe. After a crash go into your event viewer on windows, and look at right before the crash, mine was titled a display driver error righr before my crashes. If yours lists that, look into rolling your card back before the 400 series updates. I rolled mine back to the 399.23 one, but there's a 397 that's solid too. Pull up a guide on rolling back drivers, and use DDU to remove them. I was crashing a handful of times a night, and the more I restarted and just went back in there the faster they would occur. I haven't had an issue in almost a week now. The 400 and up drivers introduced the support for the RTX cards and for some reason something in there doesn't play well with others.

This women wants to be in a relationship with women of colour, she doesn’t want to just sleep with them and end up with a Caucasian women, according to her she prefers women of colour. She literally stated why she wants be with women of colour, (which was, nurturing, upfront etc) and I truly believe nothing she stated came off as a racial fetish, but rather as a preference; that might have stemmed from the environment and community she’s either around or had been around. 

As a black women, I am very cautious of other races showing interest because I know how our people were treated, displayed and chased! I do the best I can to be mindful of that. That said, I think we should also be cautious of caucasian women telling other non-POC that their attractions towards women of colour are fetish’s when it’s not, that only leads to more separation.
