###Tips For Social Distancing, Quarantine, And Isolation During An Infectious Disease Outbreak

**What Is Social Distancing?**

Social distancing is a way to keep people from interacting closely or frequently enough to spread an infectious disease. Schools and other gathering places such as movie theaters may close, and sports events and religious services may be cancelled.

**What Is Quarantine?**

Quarantine separates and restricts the movement of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. It lasts long enough to ensure the person has not contracted an infectious disease.

**What Is Isolation?**

Isolation prevents the spread of an infectious disease by separating people who are sick from those who are not. It lasts as long as the disease is contagious.

##What To Expect: Typical Reactions

Everyone reacts differently to stressful situations such as an infectious disease outbreak that requires social distancing, quarantine, or isolation. People may feel:

- **Anxiety, worry, or fear related to**:  
- Your own health status  
- The health status of others whom you may have exposed to the disease  
- The resentment that your friends and family may feel if they need to go into quarantine as a result of contact with you  
- The experience of monitoring yourself, or being monitored by others for signs and symptoms of the disease  
- Time taken off from work and the potential loss of income and job security  
- The challenges of securing things you need, such as groceries and personal care items  
- **Concern** about being able to effectively care for children or others in your care  
- **Uncertainty or frustration** about how long you will need to remain in this situation, and uncertainty about the future  
- **Loneliness** associated with feeling cut off from the world and from loved ones  
- **Anger** if you think you were exposed to the disease because of others’ negligence  
- **Boredom and frustration** because you may not be able to work or engage in regular day-to-day activities  
- **Uncertainty or ambivalence** about the situation  
- **A desire** to use alcohol or drugs to cope  
- **Symptoms of depression**, such as feelings of hopelessness, changes in appetite, or sleeping too little or too much  
- **Symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)**, such as intrusive distressing memories, flashbacks (reliving the event), nightmares, changes in thoughts and mood, and being easily startled.

##Ways To Support Yourself During Social Distancing, Quarantine, and Isolation

#UNDERSTAND THE RISK

Consider the real risk of harm to yourself and others around you. The public perception of risk during a situation such as an infectious disease outbreak is often inaccurate. Media coverage may create the impression that people are in immediate danger when really the risk for infection may be very low. Take steps to get the facts:

- Stay up to date on what is happening, while limiting your media exposure. Avoid watching or listening to news reports 24/7 since this tends to increase anxiety and worry. Remember that children are especially affected by what they hear and see on television.  
- Look to credible sources for information on the infectious disease outbreak.

#BE YOUR OWN ADVOCATE

Speaking out about your needs is particularly important if you are in quarantine, since you may not be in a hospital or other facility where your basic needs are met. Ensure you have what you need to feel safe, secure, and comfortable.

- Work with local, state, or national health officials to find out how you can arrange for groceries and toiletries to be delivered to your home as needed.  
- Inform health care providers or health authorities of any needed medications and work with them to ensure that you continue to receive those medications.

#EDUCATE YOURSELF

Health care providers and health authorities should provide information on the disease, its diagnosis, and treatment.

- Do not be afraid to ask questions—clear communication with a health care provider may help reduce any distress associated with social distancing, quarantine, or isolation.  
- Ask for written information when available.  
- Ask a family member or friend to obtain information in the event that you are unable to secure this information on your own.

#WORK WITH YOUR EMPLOYER TO REDUCE FINANCIAL STRESS

If you’re unable to work during this time, you may experience stress related to your job status or financial situation.

- Provide your employer with a clear explanation of why you are away from work.  
- Contact the U.S. Department of Labor tollfree at 1-866-487-2365 about the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), which allows U.S. employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious medical conditions, or to care for a family member with a serious medical condition.  
- Contact your utility providers, cable and Internet provider, and other companies from whom you get monthly bills to explain your situation and request alternative bill payment arrangements as needed.

#CONNECT WITH OTHERS

Reaching out to people you trust is one of the best ways to reduce anxiety, depression, loneliness, and boredom during social distancing, quarantine, and isolation. You can:

- Use the telephone, email, text messaging, and social media to connect with friends, family, and others.  
- Talk “face to face” with friends and loved ones using Skype or FaceTime.  
- If approved by health authorities and your health care providers, arrange for your friends and loved ones to bring you newspapers, movies, and books.  
- Sign up for emergency alerts via text or email to ensure you get updates as soon as they are available.  
- Call SAMHSA’s free 24-hour Disaster Distress Helpline at 1-800-985-5990, if you feel lonely or need support.  
- Use the Internet, radio, and television to keep up with local, national, and world events.  
- If you need to connect with someone because of an ongoing alcohol or drug problem, consider calling your local Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous offices.

#TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR

If you are in a medical facility, you may have access to health care providers who can answer your questions. However, if you are quarantined at home, and you’re worried about physical symptoms you or your loved ones may be experiencing, call your doctor or other health care provider:

- Ask your provider whether it would be possible to schedule remote appointments via Skype or FaceTime for mental health, substance use, or physical health needs.

#USE PRACTICAL WAYS TO COPE AND RELAX

- Relax your body often by doing things that work for you-take deep breaths, stretch, meditate or pray, or engage in activities you enjoy.  
- Pace yourself between stressful activities, and do something fun after a hard task.  
- Talk about your experiences and feelings to loved ones and friends, if you find it helpful.  
- Maintain a sense of hope and positive thinking; consider keeping a journal where you write down things you are grateful for or that are going well

My guess is that the Recreance was a deliberate and conscious abandonment of their ideals, and this led to the spren dying immediately. It was intentional and the Radiants did it on the spot. With Kaladin though, he was planning to do things which broke his oath, but he didn't actually go through with the assasination attempt on Elhokar. If Kaladin had not stood back up to Moash, he would have officially abandoned the oath and Syl would have died. Because he turned back at the last moment however he maintained his oath and brought Syl back from the edge of fading away. 

The only other guess I would have is that Kaladin isnt a full Radiant yet, and maybe his connection with Syl isnt as strong as the other Radiants bonds to their spren were. When Dalinar sees the Recreance the Radiants are all full shardbearers that have sworn the 4th ideal at least (since they have shardplate) so maybe their connection was stronger to their spren.

With the vid, yeah it's unfortunate that someone might say something but you should do your own research if they provide a video. Some tips to look at - What are the CEs that they use, is it leveled/MLB'ed? What about the servant, grailed, gold fou'd? If they're doing a min turn setup, are those extra stats a defining factor (you may need to dig into a damage calculator). Are there a lot of close calls in the video? That may indicate that it's a very RNG solo, which means it's kind of awful to to replicate though usually something you can fix with a CS revive. Sometimes you do have to save scum for good RNG, I certainly do a good amount myself for CQs. Due to game RNG though, people get different experiences on the difficult of quests since most of us don't re-try CQs and you can't redo story quests. 

But I would hardly compare Deva to the Shimosa fight, considering the lack of break bars and bullshit AoE charm every turn. The fact you got through to Shimosa itself should mean you can do Deva, have you just looked at the quest? Unless you're going for a full bonus team, it shouldn't be too bad. Like a support Ozy could deal really well with both Lu Bu and the boss. Honestly an Ozy with all his buffs procced could probably brave chain Lu Bu in a single turn.
