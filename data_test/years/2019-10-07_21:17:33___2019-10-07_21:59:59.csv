[],,LostCommonality,,,,,,[],,"Well this is anything but simple but I was told to post this here instead of making a standalone post so......

**No simple TL;DR, read if you‚Äôre willing.** This is a long post, but very, deeply important to me.

So basic info: live in Cali, Central Valley. Currently finishing an AA for Transfer in English. At the risk of tooting my own horn too much, my grades are great and make me very desirable. And I have an okay bit of extracurricular stuff and decent essay skills to make a good application to all but the most top-tier colleges.

If you want to know what my passion is, what makes me happy and joyful in life: writing. At the moment it‚Äôs mostly limited to fanfiction, but I have found a profound love of storytelling. Ever since I was a kid, I‚Äôve always been fascinated by stories, by making them up, finding them in odd places, just being creative in general. I can‚Äôt properly type out how deep this passion runs. Of course, I would love to start working on original stuff as well.

**To get this out of the way: what‚Äôs my ultimate career goal?** To one day be the head writer of (thing). Said thing could be anything from TV shows, to web shows (Think Rooster Teeth sort of web shows), video games, possibly movies, etc. The stuff that I grew up on. Just to be a creative lead/head writer for an original IP for me would be a glorious dream come true.

So the issue? Sort of a money v passion thing.

I have no fucking clue where to go from here. As of me typing this it is Oct. 7, and College applications here in Cali run from Oct 1 to Nov 30. I won‚Äôt bore you with my life story but: I am sick and tired of this hometown. Its‚Ä¶ fine, but I want out. I graduated in 2016, I‚Äôve waited long enough, i‚Äôm tired of failing (I‚Äôve been to college before, long story as to what failed). I want to get it right this time. I can‚Äôt stand another year living here, partly due to financial reasons. That is off the table.

I‚Äôm looking for advice as to how to proceed here, from anybody who can help. The truth is, my financial situation is not great, I can‚Äôt keep relying on my parents much longer. I desperately need to be able to sustain myself, and to get a career where I can get by without constantly asking for money.

The money option: I‚Äôve always liked planes and birds and just aerodynamical stuff, so early on in my life, engineer was an interesting career option. Maybe designing flying things of some sort, or vehicles, since I do love fast cars. And aero engineers are something usually in pretty high demand, so I‚Äôm confident that with dedication, this could land me a nice job and sustain me. 

The passion option: Engineering is fine, tolerable, but it would never truly bring me happiness or satisfaction in my existence. In my life, I‚Äôve found that when I truly feel amazing and fulfilled as a human being is when I publish a story people like, or one where people take the time to comment and critique. This is what drives me, this is what makes me feel alive and meaningful. So studying for a writing degree of some kind seems good. Maybe Screenwriting, or is that too limited to film? Is Creative Writing too vague? No idea, but something along those lines. To just fully embrace this passion and go find a career in it.

Bullet points:

\-Engineer almost guarantees (with enough dedication) a well-paying career, Writing does not. Especially in CA, very saturated market, lots of financial instability. I don‚Äôt want to die both penniless AND with broken dreams.

\-Like I mentioned, I love to write, but it‚Äôs a very ‚ÄúRaw‚Äù skill atm. It‚Äôs not terrible, I don‚Äôt think, but I‚Äôm someone who excels when I have some sort of guidance/a teacher. Hence why I usually do great at school. Having instruction to refine my skills is where I do my absolute best.

\-Why study engineering? Well‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going to be difficult to get a job in such a high-tech field without a degree, isn‚Äôt it? And again, pays pretty decently.

\-Why study writing? Many famous writers don‚Äôt at all have degrees, so why study it in college? Because to me, college would have two functions: One, to refine my raw skill into something polished and exceptional. Two, and perhaps most critically: help me connect and network. Help me start to get a foot in that industry, help me meet people I can network with, get my name out there as a promising student, get those internships, get maybe some freelance work, which can turn into a professional career, where I could one day pitch my own ideas to people who now know me.

So there. I‚Äôm utterly torn, and I‚Äôve got two months to decide. I want, with all my heart, to pursue this passion, but I need financial stability, my parents aren‚Äôt getting any younger and can‚Äôt keep helping for much longer. I‚Äôve got no idea what kind of degree to pursue, what career paths I have, just this distant dream that is the sum of all I‚Äôve desired, of what makes me feel happy and fulfilled. But in a world this cold and harsh‚Ä¶ money makes it go around, and I can‚Äôt be the struggling artist living off his parents.

This haunts my every waking hour as the decision looms. No idea what I can do, what I should do. I‚Äôve tried to talking to 2 or 3 academic counselors, but most give very general or vague advice. They‚Äôre focused on getting me into a college: it‚Äôs a bit hard to describe this huge life story and my long-term concerns.

If you made it through this, you‚Äôre an amazing person, thank you. Not used to people caring this much about my problems.

Summary questions:

\-Money or passion?  
 \-If I chose money, what could I do to also further my writing career/education at the same time?  
 \-If I chose passion, what kind of jobs could a degree in writing (And more important, the networking I could do in college) get me? Something sustainable, or something that could be a step to my eventual goal I mentioned?

I expect that that my seeing or hearing of such things feels as confusing and hurtful as stories like these ones feel to the average member.  

That my impulse to blame society for toxic lives isn't all that different than a member's impulse to blame the person for not implementing beliefs correctly, should they lead to isolation, bitterness, and self loathing.

That isn't saying that what is described by demisexuality isn't real, just that it wasn't worth noting in society as different enough to need to be an identity. 

Like I'm also not accusing someone saying they're a demisexual of being a ""special snowflake."" At most I'd say it's a really sad statement on our society that someone that doesn't desire to engage in hookup culture and feels the need to have an emotional connection prior to wanting a physically intimate relationship would feel so othered as to need a label to be comfortable with themselves. 

As for the rest about dating, you should be able to simply say you want to take things slowly or need a deep, emotional connection before sex. There shouldn't be a need to make that an identity.
