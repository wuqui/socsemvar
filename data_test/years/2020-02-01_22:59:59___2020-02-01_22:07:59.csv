We loved your post, *Please donate to the Souper Bowl of Caring during the Super Bowl to tackle hunger.*, but it has been removed because it doesn't quite abide by our rules, which are located in the sidebar.

* (**Rule #1**) Posts must be memes. A meme can be an image with superimposed text, or a classic meme template, or a webcomic, or other things - but it must be meant for public sharing &amp; resharing.  Just a photo, story, or gif isn't necessarily a meme.  A screenshot that lacks any meme format or context isn't a meme.  And anything private isn't a meme, because it was never meant to spread virally/memeticallly. 

* Please note that social media posts are no longer allowed as memes, see [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/wholesomememes/comments/dpurn9/you_asked_we_listened_social_media_posts_are_no/) for more information.
