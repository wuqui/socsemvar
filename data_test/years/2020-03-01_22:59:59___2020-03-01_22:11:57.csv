before yall jump to conclusions, lemme tell the story

so theres a guy my friend really likes and i think hes cute too. two days ago, she told me to message him as a joke so i did, and he ended up responding. 

she decided to make a throwaway account to dm him from because he rejected her two years ago when she told him she liked him and she was scared he would hate her or something

so she doesnt tell him who she is, but that means that he thinks i'm behind the throwaway account 

conversation became a bit dry after that and he started ghosting me, only responding once in the past two days

earlier today, i saw that the throwaway was active so i wanted to know if she was talking to him when he was ghosting me because if she was, ngl i'm gonna feel pretty jealous, maybe a little betrayed?

as well as this, i want to prove to him that im not the throwaway, but to do that i need her to help me and she doesnt want to. she thinks it'll destroy her chances of being with him (which already dont exist because hes only dming her to find out who she is). she also thinks that he'll figure out who she is if she proves it isnt me (even though there are 227 people in our grade, and over 700 in our school).

i'd be lying if i said i wasnt upset that she wont help me, but im going to support her decision anyway. i just dont think we have anything to lose if we prove it isnt me because itll just mean he'll talk to me again, she'll get more screenshots, and we get to know him better

am i the asshole for wanting her to prove that im not ""catfish?"" 

this is probably worth mentioning, but i dont want to date him. my friend does,  but i've only been talking to him to be friends.

might also be worth mentioning, im 14, friend is 15, guy is 14

&gt; # [ABC: Medio millón de dólares mensuales gana Diosdado Cabello en sus negocios ilegales - El Carabobeño](https://www.el-carabobeno.com//755)
&gt; 
&gt;   
&gt;   
&gt; [[Image](https://www.el-carabobeno.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Diosdado-Cabello-6-696x492.jpg ""Diosdado Cabello"")](https://www.el-carabobeno.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Diosdado-Cabello-6.jpg)
&gt; 
&gt;   Una red de contrabando de oro, gasolina y drogas supuestamente lideraría el número dos del régimen chavista Diosdado Cabello. Red a través de la cual, percibe alrededor de medio millón de dólares mensuales, que le entregan en mano, en un sobre, cada uno de los comandantes de los 24 estados venezolanos, reporta el ABC de España.
&gt; 
&gt; Fuentes relacionadas al alto mando del Ejército venezolano, revelaron al portal de investigación que los militares no solo participan en el tráfico de drogas; también manejarían el contrabando de combustible en la frontera colombovenezolana, la minería ilegal de oro al sur del país, y el tráfico de armas y el de personas por las costas.
&gt; 
&gt; Todo este entramado de corrupción contaría con el auspicio de la Oficina Nacional Antidrogas (ONA), encargada de “combatir el tráfico ilícito y prevenir el uso indebido de drogas”, se lee en el trabajo periodístico.
&gt; 
&gt; Esta oficina, adscrita al Ministerio de Relaciones Interiores a cargo del mayor general Néstor Reverol, tiene un comandante en cada Estado encargados de liderar los operativos.
&gt; 
&gt; “En las inspecciones rutinarias encontramos cargamentos que si pertenecen a alguien importante dentro del Gobierno no lo tocamos”, detalló a ABC otro alto mando y apuntó que los comandantes piden un porcentaje en dólares llamada “vacuna” por dejar pasar la droga y no incautarla.
&gt; 
&gt; ## **El control de la economía ilícita de Venezuela**
&gt; 
&gt; Según la publicación, cada comandante recolecta en negro una cantidad de dinero en “vacunas” que llevan a Caracas personalmente cada 15 días. Pueden ser montos de entre 10.000 y 15.000 dólares que varía de acuerdo a la productividad de cada Estado y que se entregan personalmente y en mano a Diosdado Cabello, dice la fuente militar.
&gt; 
&gt; Al militar se le pregunta por qué precisamente a él, y responde: “Es el hombre de los negocios”.
&gt; 
&gt; Las Fuerzas Armadas Bolivarianas controlan la economía ilícita del país, lo afirma también la Junta Internacional de Fiscalización de Estupefacientes (JIFE, dependiente de la ONU) en su informe anual de 2019 difundido en Viena, donde se señala que los militares se han infiltrado en el negocio del narcotráfico a través del “Cártel de los Soles”.
&gt; 
&gt; Este informe ratifica una información que publicó en exclusiva ABC el 27 de enero de 2015, luego corroborada y ampliada por el periódico The Wall Street Journal.
&gt; 
&gt; ## **Estados fronterizos autopistas de la droga**
&gt; 
&gt; Los Estados fronterizos como Zulia, Táchira y Apure son autopistas para la exportación de droga y el contrabando de combustible, el estado Bolívar al sur del país tiene en su territorio el arco minero de donde sale la expotación ilegal del oro, y los estados del norte se benefician de control de puertos y aeropuertos.
&gt; 
&gt; Las Fuerzas Armadas han demostrado ser el elemento clave para mantener al chavismo en el poder. El Ministerio de la Defensa en Venezuela, a cargo de Vladimir Padrino López, cuenta con 150.000 efectivos (España dispone de 130.000 aproximadamente), sin contar a la milicia bolivariana, nuevo componente incluido por Nicolás Maduro.
&gt; 
&gt; Pero los militares no se salvan de los estragos de una crisis humanitaria y económica -sin parangón en la región- que ha expulsado a más de cinco millones de personas fuera de sus fronteras.
&gt; 
&gt; ## **Negocio total**
&gt; 
&gt; Maduro ha tenido que comprar la lealtad de los militares para el sostenimiento de revolución chavista a cambio de ascensos y poder en la cúpula política y del manejo de la economía negra del país, revela la publicación.
&gt; 
&gt; El poder de los militares en el Estado está en más de 40 empresas militares, el manejo de Veximca (Venezolana de Exportaciones e Importaciones C.A), Camimpeg (Compañía Anónima Militar de Industrias Mineras, Petrolíferas y de Gas), la mision abastecimiento soberano con las bolsas del CLAP, al frente de la cual están 500 militares; siete puertos nacionales, el Instituto Nacional de Aereonáutica Civil con 73 aeropuertos nacionales e internacionales; diez ministerios con militares concentrados en las carteras donde hay más dinero, y siete gobernaciones claves.
&gt; 
&gt; “Estos son negocios de alto mando, no son negocios de soldados o cabos, pero por supuesto algo les toca”, afirma para ABC el diputado venezolano, Wiliam Dávila, miembro de la comisión de política exterior de la Asamblea Nacional.
&gt; 
&gt; Los que tienen la jefatura son miembros del Gobierno que protegen el negocio. Es más, los militares no hacen nada sin que lo sepa Maduro y Padrino López, expresa Dávila quien agrega que el informe de la JIFE respalda que Venezuela es un estado delincuencial y pone a prueba la respuesta de la comunidad internacional.

First of all, I don't understand how people believe that just because someone is an artist/musician they don't have to pay them for their work. I just hate this ""I'll pay for your next meal, okay?"" or ""Do we really have to pay since we are family/friends"" mentality. ESPECIALLY if you are friends/family you SHOULD pay to support them and like OP said he usually does paid gigs AND he was willing to give in provided that there was food prepared for him. And then arriving with fast-food that's not even vegan? Really an AH move.

BUT it was your sister's wedding, her big day. And suddenly she was left standing there with no music at all. Can you imagine how awkward it must have been walking down the aisle, in front of you the love of your life... and it's just quiet. Like, you can hear uncle Billy coughing in the last row and your cousin's baby starts crying in the first row and everybody is praying for the bride to walk faster so that this awkward tense atmosphere will be over and someone starts to speak again.   
Giving that there seem to be problems with you and your family like you implied, it just appears as a really weird situation and I don't know how it would have crossed your boundaries but I just feel like you both should have compromised in some way instead of walking away and having a good day for yourself.
