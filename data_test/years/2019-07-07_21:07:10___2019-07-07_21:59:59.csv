[],,gstudentusca7,,,[],,,,text,t2_3mua6u75,False,,"Thank you for your response. It actually immediately reminded me that I too, am an introvert. I'm a grown ass adult and I still have trouble initiating conversation with new people. I am a law student and I reeeeally struggle with networking events because even in the professional realm, its so hard for me to work up the courage to approach people. If people approach me and start talking, I'm totally fine. So I can totally relate to the way you felt and how some shy/awkward young kids feel. I hadn't even thought about considering how I am in social settings when I was thinking about meeting his daughters today, so thank you for opening my eyes to that! 

However, my SO has clued me into the fact that his 7 year old struggles with selective mutism. He did explicitly tell me that she panics and doesn't do well when adults try to force themselves on her. He basically verbatim said ""you just have to wait to let her come to you."" So that is why I was hesitant to try to interact with her today. I didn't want to stress her out and make her feel like she ""had"" to talk to me. Although it is discouraging for me at this point, I want her to warm up to me on her own terms if that is what she needs. It's not that I don't want to make an effort with her, I genuinely want to WANT to be around her. 
That said, I also completely understand that it is way harder for a kid to approach an adult. So now I'm trying to reconcile that with my SO's belief that allowing her to approach me on her own terms would be best. Of course it is possible he's maybe doing a bit of coddling with this approach? Idk. I know some parents aren't always the most objective/well-reasoned when it comes to what is truly best for their kids, so maybe the ""let her come to you"" approach isn't necessarily ALWAYS best, but I do want to respect his boundaries and his wishes with respect to his kids. He does know them way better than I do, after all. I want to give him  and her therapist the benefit of the doubt that maybe for this particular kid, allowing them to open up on their own terms without pressure or excessive ""efforts"" from adults is best.

Do you have any advice for helping her feel comfortable in the future? I don't want to trample on my SO's warning that it would be best for her/me to allow her to warm up on her own terms, but I can also see what you're saying about it being harder for her to figure out how to befriend me. I don't want to come off like I'm not making an effort or that I'm not interested in eventually being close with her, but I also don't want to make efforts that will trigger her anxiety/mutism and make her uncomfortable around me. Do you have any tips for striking a balance between too much/too little in my future interactions with her?

That doesn't mean you need to get married.

You ride MTB? Go to a ski hill and ride with some guys. Find a local MTB club and go for a few group rides, get numbers. Ride a popular trail on a weekend and chat at the trailhead.

You like to motorcycle? Find a club that includes your brand of bike. Go to a bike show. Go to the local biker hangout. I had a guy chase me down when I moved into a new area because he and I were riding the same bike and he invited me to their club meeting right there on the roadside. Start your own ride.
