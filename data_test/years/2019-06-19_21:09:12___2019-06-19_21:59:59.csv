Careful not to burn yourself so use thick gloves. Keep watering and wiping as the grill cools. As the grill cools, the metal contracts and squeezes excess oil out so just keep wiping it up with water and a rag. Let the grill cool fully and wipe again with mild dish soap and water. Clean off the soap with just water and a rag. Then turn your grill on high and season it with canola oil, flaxseed oil or (my recommendation) grape seed oil.
