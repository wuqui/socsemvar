[],,OpinionGenerator,,,[],,,,text,t2_5c6zi,False,,"Reading your other responses, OP, I don't think you're really in the ""right"" mindset for Antonioni (not to say it is ""right"" to BE in that mindset in the first place). You mentioned liking other films without plot, but they're a bit sensational and I wouldn't quite throw all films without a plot into the same category (not that I'm saying you are or anything).

Having said that, like another user mentioned, Blow Up is one of my least favorite of his films, though I still like it. Incidentally, you mentioned hating Zabriskie Point and I thought that film was genius.

If you haven't already, I'd go back to his alienation trilogy to get a real sense of what he's doing and I'll name a few things I really like about what that is below.

First, he really changed the grammar of film (if you google grammar and antonioni, you'll find a lot to read about) in ways that though have been imitated, haven't really been fully embraced by even modern directors because they're so odd (but in subtle ways). An example would be how he constantly keeps faces, especially during important scenes, hidden from us. This is not only a rebellious thing to do, it's also directly linked to themes with which he's dealing.

Along those lines, his tendency to use cinematic time and space in unconventional ways (like long takes), is something that again, is not only rebellious, but brings about its own qualities. A lot of his shots are like moving paintings that would look great on a loop (moving forward, than in reverse). His shots mean a lot more to him than a lot of other directors that stick with the typical, establishing shot, to medium shot, to close-up, to medium as a transition back to another close-up, etc.

This brings me to the third thing which is visually, his images are loaded with a lot more content/subtext than most directors (and I'm including the art-house scene too). It's easy to kind of google these films and say, ""Oh, I get"" and then reduce it to something like this, ""This is just a film about bourgeois ennui,"" but you'll find a lot of layered stuff in that (not to mention his films are really just about that).

Like I said before, I like Blow-Up, but not to the same degree because he actually seems to be doing less of what I'm talking about in that film perhaps, to gain a more mainstream audience (incidentally, it was his biggest and most successful film).

Still, there are some cool moments within the film. Obviously the mime thing was really interesting especially given the context of the film dealing with reality. But more interesting to me was the scene before it where he tricks us into thinking we're watching a POV shot from the protagonist only for the shot to track back to his face. There's a lot of these little gems in there if you look.

Really though, Antonioni, I think, is best watched on a very relaxed, quiet Sunday afternoon. Don't be afraid to take a few breaks in between scenes and stretch. Take your time with them. Think about the feeling you get just staring out at a landscape like an ocean or a forest where you're put at ease, and get yourself in the mindset. Be patient and take in the imagery (the cinematography in his films is also great and there are plenty of youtube videos that highlight this). If self-medicating or meditation helps you reach that mindset, give it a try.

The slow pace and distance created within his films has been some of the most emotionally effective stuff for me personally.",False,False,,2019-06-01 21:45:46,,False,{},eprjbc9,False,t3_bvggxf,False,True,t3_bvggxf,/r/TrueFilm/comments/bvggxf/does_anyone_else_think_michaelangelo_antonionis/eprjbc9/,1559425557.0,1.0,True,False,TrueFilm,t5_2szp0,0.0,1559418346.0,

So what we can deduct from this is that the Starlink network isn't particularly suitable for IoT applications that require tiny transceivers, or any use-cases that require easy portability. I think they said that fitting it in a car would be possible, but apparently that's about as far as it goes.

I think Iridium is soon coming out with the 9970 transceiver - they showed a prototype the size of an Anker power bank in an investor conference and said the final version would be a fraction of that size.
