Keeping a modern submarine neutrally buoyant occupies the full attention of the Diving Officer of the Watch (“DIVE”) and Chief of the Watch while they are on watch. Continually accounting for all buoyancy changes caused by making fresh water when the evaporator or still is running, compensating for water pumped off the ship in the form of sanitary tank effluent and/or trash is one of the key tasks. 

Submarines cannot inherently remain neutrally buoyant. Changes in temperature, salinity, rivers flowing in, etc mean an ever-changing environment.

Now, in theory, the boat could be somewhat negatively buoyant and come to rest on a “layer.” The more likely scenario is that while at periscope depth, the boat is trimmed heavy overall/heavy aft to counteract the suction forces of sea state trying to suck the boat to the surface (maintaining periscope depth is extremely difficult) and if everyone died, the boat would probably go down hard or broach to the surface. Not sure how the U-boats rolled in those days.

When I say difficult to maintain periscope depth, I mean in normal sea state, with modern control systems and instruments. The WWII guys must have been absolute fucking bad asses, doing so with everything basically manual.

We’re also talking about the North Atlantic, which is a fucking beast mode place to operate. The sea is violent.

Anyway, thanks for coming to my TED Talks “Ideas worth spreading.” Here’s “Wonderwall”
