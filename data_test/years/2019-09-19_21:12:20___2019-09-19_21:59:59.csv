Back then these were mostly simple ports of the arcade original, often losing a good heft of visual, and technically, fidelity at the cost of being on a home console A remaster, however implies, to me, that the game isn't just a marked improvement from the original release, but intentionally advertised as so. The [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_remakes_and_remastered_ports) article lists a *lot* of games, off the top of my head.

Off the top of my head, Im tempted to say the Mario remakes in the Super Mario All-Star rerelease. The graphics where updated, a staple for remasters and generally considered the bare minimum to differentiate from just a port, and I believe some very slight gameplay changes (dont quote me on that) but I dont know that for sure. With a '93 release date, Im fairly certain there must be something sooner.

SO, I sorted the list by the rerelease system. First to come up that looks possible (and this is assuming this is a compete list, which is certainly is NOT) Space Quest and Police Quest both got rereleased in '90 and '91 with VGA graphics and a new point and click interface. So, I know I said graphics are generally a good indicator of a rerelease vs port, but as these were both PC games back then, I dont think that alone is enough. Often game developers back then would do the game in 2, or 3 art styles depending on the systems they wanted to release on.
