Title: **I think my card details were copied/stolen during a Drive-Thru Transaction. Unsure of how to move forward.**

Original Post: 

&gt; After I gave the cashier my card he turned away from the interface/receipt printer, and walked to the front of the establishment, looked out of the front door, then walked back grabbed our receipt after he handed us the card alone. He then opened and closed the window a couple times, tried valiantly to not look preposterously stoned while putting our drink lids on and missing the sauce going into the bag. Me and SO just laugh, like 'wow, kinda weird of him to walk off with card, but w/e i'm sure he's just trying to keep it together.' This morning we see a charge that we've never seen before and can't identify. We wait a bit then call the bank where they confirm the fraudulent overseas charge. We now would like to obtain or possibly have police view the security footage just to make sure, but we are truly not sure how to move forward. I called the establishment, but it seemed like a junior manager, and when i asked if there was someone else that would be more suited to handle this type of thing, she asked me to call back tomorrow. I don't want to get anyone in trouble, or seem forceful, I just want to make sure I'm doing my due diligence here.
