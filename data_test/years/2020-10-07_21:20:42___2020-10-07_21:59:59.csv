I can't remember where I found this, but it looks like there's a group out there trying to make an affirmative argument for the 30 year leases here: [https://ourbestlongmont.org/pages/voter-guide/](https://ourbestlongmont.org/pages/voter-guide/)

To try to address some of your questions as someone who is just trying to learn about it myself...

&gt;""registered electors of any city may adopt, amend and repeal a municipal home rule charter"" (*okay, yes we can but why should we?)*

Seems like the reason you should is because of the argument made in that voter guide: That it is a way for the city to provide new services without actually having to spend any money.

&gt;""Charter currently states that leases of City property may not be granted for longer than 20 years"" *(this is the current law, again, why does it need changing?)*

Here's how I understand the argument. Long term leases of city property let the person leasing that property do stuff with it that you just can't get done in a year, like build a building or lay down infrastructure so that you can provide some service like social services for the homeless. That stuff costs money, and so you need to be able to stretch that cost over a long period of time with something that looks like a mortgage.

A 20 year mortgage is more expensive on a monthly basis than a 30 year mortgage, and there's no other city on the front range who limits themselves to 20 year leases anyway.

&gt;*okay, are we talking purchases or leases? For leases, can you imagine being able to lock in your rent for 30 years?? By not signing new leases at the 20 year mark (even 20 years seems pretty long term), is the City trying to give money away to someone by letting them lock in for 30 years??*

It doesn't seem to me like the city is trying to make money on this at all, let alone give money away. The relevant portion of the charter that's amended seems like it's explicitly just about letting people rent city property.
