For the “can I keep honoring other gods/can I accept blessings from other gods”, that’s really something to ask Hades himself. Does He care? If so, include those stipulations in the oath. If He doesn’t, then it’s up to you whether that’s something you’d like to do.

As for consequences, that’s really up to Lord Hades. Breaking the oath can be as harmless as disappointing Him, or as serious as losing your life, and you have to talk with Hades about it first.
