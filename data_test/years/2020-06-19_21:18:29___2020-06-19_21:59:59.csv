In *Necropolis* by Dan Abnett, one of the Gaunts Ghosts books set in on a Hive World, the Ghosts ( a rather low-status unit) are issued:

* tins of soup that heat themselves when a foil strip is pulled
* packages of cornmeal crackers
* tins of preserved fish
* cartons of pasteurized milk
* packages of 'soya cakes' (through context, its tofu)
* tins of vegetables packed in oil
* Electrolyte rehydration solutions (essentially Gatorade)
* are later given bread, beer and broth

More importantly, Tona Criid, a *very* low-status gang-girl from the Out-Habs, recognizes all of this when she steals it and isn't surprised to see it, suggesting such foodstuffs aren't rare even for an Out-Hab wretch like herself

In the same book, a middle-status Guild official is having breakfast, consisting of an egg souffle, fresh fruit, IIRC a ham steak, and a gigantic carafe of fresh coffee bolstered by liquor. Such a meal was apparently against rationing regulations.

In another book in the Ghosts series, the Ghosts are fighting on a Cardinal World, Aexe Cardinal, which is basically WW1 Europe. They are issued the same rations as the local military forces, consisting of a thin soup made of fish and root vegetables, bread, and weak beer. 

In several of the Ghosts books, mention is made of a foodstuff called ""slab"", which is implied to be a paste of legumes and/or starches, bland on its own but flavorable with other stuff

In the *Ravenor* series, also by Dan Abnett, mention is made of a Hive World coliseum-cum-circus entertainment complex called Carnivora, that *explicitly* distinguishes between the meat from slaughtered ringfighting animals and the corpses of killed ringfighting humans, since the animal meat is sold for food while the humans explicitly are not. In another world in the same series, IIRC an Agri-world, the economy of that world is based off the sale of large animals (IIRC called ""bronchiodonts""), where the majority of the meat from same is described as being ground into hamburger for sale to non-wealthy Imperial citizens on other worlds in the Sector, while the prime cuts of meat are sold in the round to discerning customers with the money to spend.

In *Titanicus*, also by Dan Abnett, a meal of rehydrated rice and vegetables and coffee is seen as commonplace, and after getting stranded in the middle of a warzone, particularly welcome, for both Imperial soldiers *and* non-Imperial indigenous nomadic peoples  who share a shelter at the end of the book.

Now, this is Dan Abnett, who is known for ***not*** needlessly Grimdarking his worlds.
