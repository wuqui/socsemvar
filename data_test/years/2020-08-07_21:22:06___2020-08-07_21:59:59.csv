Which means that to get the skins in the gamma case you can only open the finite amount of cases that were dropped ever. Which also means that the more cases are opened, the less there are.

Is it a good time to buy those cases? probably not since its been over invested already since the news came up (I bought 1k at .10 and .11 and now they are like .15.). Obviously cases are not the same investment as others, you only buy them for long term so usually its a good investment for money you dont really need at the moment and that wont be needed for a while.
