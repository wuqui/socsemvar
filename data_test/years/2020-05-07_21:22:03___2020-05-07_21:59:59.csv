The condition of the watch is excellent.  There are some very light scratches on the crystal that I had a hard time capturing in the photos. I did not notice them at all until I got real close to take photos.  They are minor, but they are there.  Nothing deep.  I suspect they can be buffed out, but I’m fairly new to the watch scene!  The back of the case shows normal wear—please see the photos.  The bezel has a tiny dot next to the number 10 (visible in the photos).  Small wear/imperfection on the case next to the crown.  These are all of the issues I see with this watch.  It’s  really in excellent shape and is quite the eye catcher!

I’ve taken several photos and am happy to take more. 

Watch runs and keeps time without issue! It takes a 22 mm strap. And is an automatic.  Number is: EM76C2-A 8890318.

I will ship ASAP (not currently working due to the coronavirus stuff.  Not because I have it, but because my office is closed!).  Tracking will be included!

Comedy/Banter: **SCREAM OF THOUGHTLESSNESS**

Spawned from boredom in a global pandemic, two happy-sad instagram comedians try and find their footing in the podcast world. Freshly out of the honeymoon phase of marriage, join them as they discuss an array of topics from depression to cheeseburgers &amp; share the ""you can't make this stuff up"" moments of their life, in a stream of consciousness that can only be described as ""non compos mentis."" From Executive Producer: Penny, the Black Lab.
