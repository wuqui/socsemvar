Dear /u/alishahimtiaz!

Thank you for posting on /r/resumes. Please, let we mention some important information (probably you know it).

[Wiki Guidelines about Posting a Resume](https://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/wiki/index#wiki_posting_a_resume)

Please, remember to add a **flair** to your post.

Due to the extremely increasing amount of spam/scam on the sub as posts, comments, in PM, and via GoogleAds on Reddit, we have to warn everyone about it. Unfortunately, such offers imply low-quality service - and actually, they are. Such scammers were banned, and there was some feedback on their work. So please, do not trust shady offers.  
One can find trusted professionals on the wiki - there is such a list.

We wish you get support from the sub in many ways, including reading it, top posts, wiki, and searching. There were many answered questions here, please, feel free to check that.

Besides, this subreddit is better looking in the old Reddit design on the desktop in the browser with adBlockers (FireFox/PaleMoon with uBlock Origin + uMatrix): https://old.reddit.com/r/resumes/
