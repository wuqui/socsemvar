# SocSemVar


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This repository contains the code for the paper *Semantic change and
socio-semantic variation. The case of Covid-related neologisms on
Reddit*, published in the journal *Linguistics Vanguard*.

You can clone the repository and install the code as a Python package
named `socsemvar` by running `pip install .` within the cloned
directory. This will automatically install all dependencies. As always,
it is recommended to install this package in a virtual environment
(e.g.Â using `conda`).

The Reddit data used for this paper are too big to make them available
here. Therefore, the code in this repository uses a smaller random
sample of the original data. The full datasets of Reddit comments and
the models trained from these comments can be requested via email and
allow to reproduce our results.

This repository provides the code used to process the Reddit comments,
train the models, and produce the results presented in our paper. The
code was written and documented using the literate programming framework
`nbdev` and the documentation is available here:
