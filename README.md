<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This repository contains the code for the paper *Semantic change and
socio-semantic variation. The case of Covid-related neologisms on
Reddit*, published in the journal *Linguistics Vanguard*.

You can clone the repository and install the code as a Python package
named `socsemvar` by running `pip install .` within the cloned
directory. This will automatically install all dependencies. As always,
it is recommended to install this package in a virtual environment
(e.g.Â using `conda`).

The Reddit data used for this paper are too big to make them available
here. Some parts of the code cannot be executed without having access to
these datasets. The full datasets of Reddit comments and the models
trained from these comments can be requested via email. The datasets and
models allow to reproduce our results.

This repository provides the code used to process the Reddit comments,
train the models, and produce the results presented in our paper. The
code was written and documented using the literate programming framework
`nbdev` and the documentation is available here:
